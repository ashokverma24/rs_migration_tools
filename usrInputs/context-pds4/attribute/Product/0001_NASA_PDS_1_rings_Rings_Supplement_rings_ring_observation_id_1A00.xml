        <definition>The ring_observation_id uniquely identifies a single experiment or observation (image, occultation profile, spectrum, etc.) within a rings-related data set. This is the common id by which data are identified within the Rings Node catalog. It describes the smallest quantity of data that can be usefully cataloged or analyzed by itself. Note that a single observation may be associated with multiple data products (e.g. raw and calibrated versions of an image). Note also that a single data product may be associated with multiple observations (e.g. a single WFPC2 image file containing four different images). A ring observation id is constructed using numbers, upper case letters, forward slash, colon, period, dash, and underscore as follows: p/type/host/inst/time/... where p is a single-letter planet id (one of J, S, U, or N); type is IMG for images, OCC for occultation profile, etc.; host is the instrument host id, inst is the instrument id; time is the observation time as a date or instrument clock count; further information identifying the observation can then be appended as appropriate. Optional in labels. Nillable, in which case the nil_reason should be 'inapplicable'. Examples: J/IMG/VG2/ISS/20693.01/N J/IMG/VG2/ISS/20693.02/W S/IMG/HST/WFPC2/1995-08-10/U2TF020B/PC1 U/OCC/VG2/RSS/1986-01-24/S U/OCC/VG2/RSS/1986-01-24/X N/OCC/VG2/PPS/1989-08-25/SIGMA_SGR </definition>
