    Mission Overview
    ================
      The twin Voyager spacecraft, over the course of a dozen years,
      drew back the curtain on nearly half of the solar system.  From
      launch in 1977 through the spectacular parting shots of Neptune
      at the outer reaches of the solar system in 1989, this pair of
      spacecraft explored four planets -- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and
      Neptune -- as well as dozens of moons, and the rings and
      magnetic environments of those planetary systems.
 
      The Voyagers were designed to take advantage of a rare geometric
      arrangement of the outer planets that occurs only once every 176
      years.  This configuration allows a single spacecraft to swing
      by all four gas giants without the need for large onboard
      propulsion systems; the flyby of each planet both accelerates
      the spacecraft and bends its flight path.  Without these gravity
      assists, the flight time to Neptune would have been 30 years.
 
      The second of the two Voyager spacecraft, Voyager 2, was
      launched first, on 20 August 1977.  It was followed on 5
      September 1977 by Voyager 1, which was put on a faster, shorter
      trajectory to Jupiter.  Both launches took place from the Cape
      Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.
 
      Eighteen months after launch, Voyager 1 reached Jupiter, 650
      million kilometers away.  The spacecraft made its closest
      approach on 5 March 1979, while Voyager 2 followed on 9 July
      of the same year.  Images streamed back from the pair of
      spacecraft showing the complex, swirling turbulence of
      Jupiter&apos;s atmosphere in exquisite detail.  A giant storm, three
      times the size of Earth, raged in Jupiter&apos;s upper atmosphere,
      surrounded by rippling currents that rotated about it.
      Voyager 1 found nine active volcanoes erupting on Io, the
      innermost of Jupiter&apos;s four major moons.  Four months later,
      Voyager 2 found that eight of the nine volcanoes were still
      active.  A thin, dusty ring was also discovered around Jupiter,
      forcing revision of theories about origins and mechanics of
      planetary ring systems.
 
      At Saturn, both Voyagers took high-resolution images to help
      determine ring composition and dynamics.  The Voyager 1
      encounter took place in November 1980 and the Voyager 2
      encounter was in August 1981.  Voyager 1 was targeted to fly
      close to Saturn&apos;s largest moon Titan.  This resulted in a
      south polar passage of Saturn, which redirected the spacecraft
      northward of the ecliptic.
 
      Voyager 2 continued on to Uranus where ten new moons were
      discovered in the Uranus system.  The planet&apos;s magnetic
      field was found to be significantly offset from the planet&apos;s
      axis of rotation.
 
      In August 1989, Voyager 2 flew past Neptune.  Because Neptune
      receives so little sunlight, many scientists had expected to
      see a placid, featureless planet.  Instead, Voyager showed a
      dynamic atmosphere with winds blowing westward, opposite the
      direction of rotation, at speeds faster than the winds of any
      other planet.  Neptune revealed its Great Dark Spot, a storm
      system that resembled Jupiter&apos;s Great Red Spot, and a smaller,
      eastwardly moving cloud, called &apos;scooter&apos;, which went around
      the planet about every 16 hours.  The blue planet was circled
      by diffuse, dusty rings; six new moons were discovered.
 
      Voyager 2 passed over the north polar region on Neptune,
      using the planet&apos;s gravity to redirect the trajectory for a
      final encounter -- with Neptune&apos;s largest moon Triton.  It then
      departed the solar system southward of the ecliptic.
 
      At about the same time as Voyager 2 was encountering Neptune,
      Voyager 1, continuing its journey to the edge of the solar
      system on the north side of the ecliptic, turned its cameras
      back to look at the planets and take one last parting shot.
      Voyager 1&apos;s &apos;family portrait&apos; illustrates the vastness of the
      solar system and the huge expanses of emptiness within which
      the outer planets lie.
 
      Both Voyagers are now headed for the outer boundary of the
      solar system, where the Sun becomes just one of many
      contributors to the interstellar environment.  That edge is
      thought to be somewhere between 8 billion and 23 billion
      kilometers from the Sun.  Engineers are optimistic that the
      Voyagers will still be transmitting data when that boundary is
      encountered sometime in the first quarter of the twenty-first
      century.
 
      The spacecraft were assembled at and the mission was managed by
      the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA.  Early parts of
      the mission have been described in more detail by
      [MORRISON1982].
 
 
    Mission Phases
    ==============
 
      VOYAGER 1 LAUNCH
      ----------------
        The launch vehicle for Voyager 1 was a Titan/Centaur.  The
        first stage Titan was powered by both solid and liquid fuel
        engines.  The Centaur stage, 20 meters long and 3 meters in
        diameter burned a fuel combination of liquid hydrogen and
        liquid oxygen.  The Titan boosted the Voyager Centaur
        combination into low Earth orbit, and the Centaur plus a
        small solid fuel rocket provided the energy for Voyager 1 to
        escape Earth orbit.

      VOYAGER 1 JUPITER-SATURN CRUISE
      -------------------------------
        During the period between Jupiter Encounter and Saturn
        Encounter, Voyager 1 probed the interplanetary medium,
        observed selected celestial targets, and conducted tests and
        calibrations of its systems.  Mission planners used the 16
        months to develop and test activity sequences which would be
        used during the Saturn Encounter.

        The Voyager 1 flyby of Saturn took place on 12 November 1980
        at 23:46 UTC with the spacecraft closest approach only 184300
        kilometers from the center of Saturn.  Among the highlights
        of the encounter were the separate encounter with Titan,
        discovery of intricate patterns within the ring system, and
        observation of variations among the many moons of Saturn.
        Closest approaches to some of the satellites were on the

      ------------------------------
        After conclusion of the Saturn Encounter, Voyager 1 left the
        ecliptic at an angle of about 30 degrees.  Its scan platform
        instruments were turned off, but some of the remaining
        instruments (primarily fields and particles) continued to
        monitor the environment in the outer solar system as the
        spacecraft traveled outward toward the heliopause.

      ---------------------------
        The Voyager 2 flyby of Jupiter took place on 9 July 1979 at
        22:29 UTC.  This was 18 weeks after the Voyager 1 Jupiter
        Encounter and was at a closest approach distance of 721670
        kilometers from the center of Jupiter.  The Voyager 2
        trajectory was chosen to complement that of Voyager 1,
        including a much closer approach to Europa, probing southern
        latitudes in Jupiter&apos;s atmosphere, and an extensive
        investigation of Jupiter&apos;s magnetotail.  Satellite encounter

      VOYAGER 2 JUPITER-SATURN CRUISE
      -------------------------------
        During the period between Jupiter Encounter and Saturn
        Encounter, Voyager 2 probed the interplanetary medium,
        observed selected celestial targets, and conducted tests and
        calibrations of its systems.  Mission planners used the 22
        months to develop and test activity sequences which would be
        used during the Saturn Encounter.

      VOYAGER 2 SATURN ENCOUNTER
      --------------------------
        The Voyager 2 closest approach to Saturn was on 26 August
        1981 at 03:24 UTC and at a distance of 161000 km from the
        center of Saturn.  The trajectory was chosen so that the
        spacecraft could obtain a gravitational assist from Saturn
        and continue on to Uranus; the timing was selected to provide
        better views of several satellites than had been obtained
        from Voyager 1.  Design of science sequences was influenced
        by Voyager 1 results.  Satellite encounters were on the dates
        and at the closest approach distances shown below; &apos;UNK&apos;
        denotes &apos;unknown&apos; at the time of this writing.  The
        scan platform seized temporarily 110 minutes after Saturn
        closest approach, causing the central computer to disable
        further commands and resulting in loss of some data.  When
        commanded again three days later (at low rate), it moved as
        instructed.  A gyroscope calibration error between closest
        approach and five hours later also caused loss of data.
        Scan platform activities ended on 5 September 1981.  This
        encounter is described in more detail by [STONE&amp;MINER1982].

      VOYAGER 2 URANUS ENCOUNTER
      --------------------------
        The Voyager 2 closest approach to Uranus was on 24 January
        1986 at 17:59 UTC at a distance of 107000 km from the
        center of Uranus.  The trajectory was chosen so that the
        spacecraft could obtain a gravitational assist from Uranus
        and continue on to Neptune; NASA permission for the Neptune
        Encounter was granted during the approach to Uranus.  The
        timing of the Uranus closest approach was selected to
        provide a close approach to Miranda and to allow capture of
        radio occultation data at the DSN tracking station in
        Australia (southern declination of Uranus meant that
        Australia was preferred for DSN tracking).  Radio
        occultation data were also collected using the 64-m
        antenna at Parkes in Australia.  Satellite encounters were
        on the dates and at the closest approach distances shown
        below.  &apos;UNK&apos; denotes &apos;unknown&apos; at the time of this writing.
        Satellite images were improved by implementation of image
        motion compensation on the spacecraft.  Reed-Solomon encoding
        was used for the first time; real-time imaging data rates
        were reduced by almost 70 percent.  Ground antennas were
        arrayed to increase receiving aperture.  This encounter is
        described in more detail by [STONE&amp;MINER1986].

      VOYAGER 2 URANUS-NEPTUNE CRUISE
      -------------------------------
        During the period between Uranus Encounter and Neptune
        Encounter, Voyager 2 probed the interplanetary medium,
        observed selected celestial targets, and conducted tests and
        calibrations of its systems.  Mission planners used the 39
        months to develop and test activity sequences which would be
        used during the Neptune Encounter.
 
        The DSN used this time to add a 34-m tracking antenna at the
        Madrid complex, to increase the diameter of their 64-m
        antennas to 70 meters, and to make the 70-m systems more
        efficient.  A special microwave link was installed to permit
        the Parkes radio telescope to be arrayed with the Canberra
        DSN antenna in Australia.

      VOYAGER 2 NEPTUNE ENCOUNTER
      ---------------------------
        The Voyager 2 closest approach to Neptune was on 25 August
        1989 at 03:56 UTC at a distance of 29240 km from the
        center of Neptune.  The trajectory and timing were chosen so
        that the spacecraft could obtain a gravitational assist from
        Neptune and continue on for an encounter with Neptune&apos;s large
        satellite Triton about five hours later (closest approach at
        09:10 UTC).  The timing was also selected so that radio
        occultation data would be collected at the DSN tracking
        station in Australia (southern declination of Neptune meant
        that Australia was preferred for DSN tracking).  Radio
        occultation data were again collected with the Parkes antenna
        and with a new 64-m antenna at Usuda in Japan.  Satellite
        encounters were on the dates and at the closest approach
        distances shown below.  &apos;UNK&apos; denotes &apos;unknown&apos; at the
        time of this writing.  Data rates were increased over those
        at Uranus by including the Very Large Array (VLA) in New
        Mexico for receiving and by taking advantage of DSN upgrades
        made over the previous three years.  This encounter is
        described in more detail by [STONE&amp;MINER1989].

      VOYAGER 2 INTERSTELLAR MISSION
      ------------------------------
        After conclusion of the Neptune Encounter, Voyager 2 left the
        ecliptic at an angle of about -30 degrees.  Its scan platform
        instruments were turned off, but some of the remaining
        instruments (primarily fields and particles) continued to
        monitor the environment in the outer solar system as the
        spacecraft traveled outward toward the heliopause.  During
        the Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact with Jupiter in July 1994, the
        ultraviolet spectrometer was trained on Jupiter and radio
        signals were recorded; but no emissions from the impact were
        detected.
