     Mission Overview
     ================
      In the late 1970s it was realised that the return of Halley&apos;s
      comet in 1985/86 would provide a unique opportunity to combine a
      mission to explore Venus, (which had already been planned) with
      a mission to Halley by employing a two-element space vehicle
      consisting of a Venus lander (and balloon) and a Halley flyby
      probe.  The mission was called Vega, a contraction of the
      Russian words `Venera&apos; (Venus) and `Gallei&apos; (Halley) and was
      conducted by the USSR with a number of other countries within
      the framework of Intercosmos.
 
      The Vega mission comprised two identical spacecraft, Vega 1 and
      Vega 2.  This was a standard approach in the USSR, aimed
      primarily at increasing the overall reliability of the mission.
      In addition, if both flybys were successful there would be a
      significant increase in the scientific return, which was
      particularly valuable in the case of the Halley flybys
      considering the variability of the cometary activity.
 
      The Vega project was truly international.  While the spacecraft
      themselves were controlled by Soviet agencies, the scientific
      programme and payload were coordinated by the International
      Science and Technical Committee (CIST), representing scientific
      institutions and space agencies from nine countries.  The CIST
      designed the Vega mission to be complementary to the European
      Giotto and the Japanese Suisei cometary missions.
 
      The two spacecraft were launched by Proton rockets from the
      cosmoport Baikonur on 15 and 21 December 1984, respectively.  On
      11 and 15 June 1985, the two spacecraft successfully delivered
      the first balloons into the Venus atmosphere.  After deltaV-
      Venus gravity assist flybys, Vega 1 and Vega 2 encountered comet
      Halley on 6 and 9 March 1986, respectively.
 
      The interplanetary orbit of Vega 1 from launch to Halley flyby
      was entirely in the ecliptic.  The orbit of Vega 2 was almost
      identical except for slightly different flyby dates.  The plane
      of Halley&apos;s orbit was inclined at 17.8 degrees with respect to
      the ecliptic. Halley was above the ecliptic from the ascending
      to the descending node. The flyby speeds were extremely high
      because Halley&apos;s orbit sense was retrograde, that is, directed
      opposite to that of the Earth and thus of the spacecraft.
      During the encounter dust particles impacted on the spacecraft
      at ~ 80 km/s and caused damage to some experiments and the
      unprotected solar panels.
 
      The flight operations centre was located in Evpatoria (Crimea),
      but during the flybys most investigators were in Moscow at the
      Space Research Institute, where they were able to obtain all the
      data in real time.  Deep space antennas in Evpatoria (70 m) and
      Medvezy Ozera (64m), near Moscow, received the telemetry.
 
      During the cruise phase the pointing platform was clamped.  The
      clamping mechanism was released on Vega 1 on 14 February 1986
      and on Vega 2 on 18 February 1986, and the operation of the TVS
      and the pointing platform was checked by observing Jupiter and
      Saturn.  The cameras were found to be fully functional.  Two
      days before the Halley encounters the cameras were oriented
      towards Halley and switched on for two hours.  At last, on 6
      March 1986, a few minutes before 7:20 UT, for the first time in
      the history of mankind, the nucleus of comet Halley unveiled
      itself to the human eye.
 
      The second encounter took place almost exactly three days later.
      (The most important parameters of both flybys are summarised in
      the Table below.)

      Vega mission operations were discontinued a few weeks after the
      encounters.  The general condition of the spacecraft would have
      allowed further operation.  The solar panels were partially
      damaged by dust impact but could still have provided enough
      power.  The camera performance was tested by observing Jupiter
      and no essential degradation was registered.  Even the amount of
      fuel onboard was considerable.  However, after extensive
      searches and debates, no interesting object was identified for a
      possible second encounter.
