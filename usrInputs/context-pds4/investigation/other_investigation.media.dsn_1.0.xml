                    The DSN Media Calibration investigation is the set of observations and analyses
                    used by the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) to develop calibrations for the effects
                    of the ionosphere, troposphere, and local weather on propagation of radio signals
                    between DSN antennas and spacecraft.  Although small, these effects are measurable
                    and can change the apparent range to and velocity of spacecraft being tracked by 
                    the DSN.

                This is the DSN Telecommunications Link Design Handbook. The reference is 
                to a PDS Collection. Each member product in the Collection comprises several 
                modules -- sometimes separate files, sometimes wrapped together into a single
                file, depending on the version of the Handbook that has been included in the
                Collection.  Modules are added, removed, and/or updated as needed. Each version
                of the Handbook (each member product of the Collection) contains all modules
                that were current as of the publication date.  Module 105 (Atmospherc and 
                Environmental effects) may be of special interest here.

                This paper discusses noise in Doppler tracking of deep space probes and 
                provides a detailed noise model for Doppler radio science experiments. 
                Current technology allows velocity measurements to better than 1 micron 
                per second when data are averaged over 1000 seconds.  Examples from 
                Cassini are included.  Applications of the noise model to experiment 
                planning are considered, and the authors discuss the prospects for 
                significant sensitivity improvements.
