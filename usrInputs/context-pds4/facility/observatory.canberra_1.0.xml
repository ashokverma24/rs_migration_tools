                An overview of the capabilities available from the Deep Space Network to support flight 
                projects and experiment investigations. The capabilities described are focused on deep 
                space missions, near-Earth missions above Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO), 
                and ground-based observational science.  Included are tables summarizing uplink
                commanding, downlink telemetry, radio frequency, and ground communication capabilities
                as well as pricing information for mission support. The document is aimed at mission 
                designers working at the proposal stage; it is updated as appropriate.

            The NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) comprises three Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs)
            spaced by approximately 120 degrees in longitude and within about 40 degrees latitude
            of Earth's equator. As the Earth rotates, this configuration provides nearly continuous 
            coverage of spacecraft in the ecliptic -- that is, spacecraft flying to or orbiting most 
            solar system objects.  The Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex (CDSCC) is one of 
            these three DSCCs.  The first antenna at the complex (DSS-42) became operational in 1964.  
            The CDSCC is managed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.
            
            The CDSCC includes several Deep Space Stations (DSSs, or antennas), a Signal Processing
            Center (SPC), and administrative and support facilities.  Each DSCC handles several types of 
            data including: frequency and timing, tracking, telemetry, command, monitor, radio science, 
            and very long baseline interferometry. These data types support uplink (to spacecraft) or 
            downlink (from spacecraft) operations or passive reception.  Data received from spacecraft
            are relayed via the local SPC to the Network Operations Control Center (NOCC) at JPL where
            where they are distributed to the offices responsible for each spacecraft.  Commands, 
            generated in those offices, are sent via the NOCC, SPC, and DSS to the spacecraft.
