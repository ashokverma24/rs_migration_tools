            Deep Space Station 35 (DSS-35) was built from 2010 to 2014, as part of the Deep Space Network 
            (DSN) Aperture Enhancement Program (DAEP), coming into service on 2014-10-01. It was officially
            opened on 2015-02-24. DSS-35 was the first of several new dishes being constructed throughout
            the DSN to provide additional communication resources to handle the expected growth in deep 
            space missions being conducted by the space agencies of many nations.  The antenna is very 
            similar in structure to DSS-45; however, the transmission and reception equipment is located 
            underground rather than in a cone at the focal point of the dish. The radio signal is guided 
            from the subreflector through a hole in the surface of the dish to the receiving equipment via
            a system of reflecting mirrors inside a large tube. The reverse path allows transmission. This
            design is called 'beam waveguide' (BWG); it reduces weight on the reflecting surface, insulates
            electronics from environmental factors including dish movement, and simplifies maintenance. 
            DSS-35 uses 'night sky cooling' to cool the transmitter. Generated heat is dissipated into 
            the concrete slab surrounding the antenna. At night, when the temperature is generally cooler, 
            the heat from the slab is released to the atmosphere.  DSS-35 can transmit up to 20 kW at 
            7.1 GHz; an 800 W transmitter at 34.5 GHz is planned for addition in late 2024.  DSS-35 can 
            receive simultaneous right- and left-circular polarization at 8.4 and 32.0 GHz.  Antenna 
            coordinates were converted from Table 5 in module 301 (revision L) of the DSN Telecommunications
            Link Design Handbook (DSN document 810-005). 
            
            The Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex (CDSCC) is managed by the Commonwealth 
            Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia's national science 
            research agency. The CDSCC is at Tidbinbilla, about 35 km southwest of Canberra, ACT.
