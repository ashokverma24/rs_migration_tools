                This reference is to a PDS collection containing several versions of the NASA Deep 
                Space Network (DSN) Telecommunications Link Design Handbook (Document 810-005).
                The Handbook is maintained in a modular format to provide interface 
                design data to flight projects using the DSN.  Modules are updated as appropriate.
                Each member product in the PDS collection is the set of modules as they applied
                at that point in time.  Modules include:

                This context product provides more information on the commanding, radio tracking, and
                radio science instrumentation at the DSN.  DSS-13, however, does not participate in
                routine commanding, radio tracking, and radio science.

           This fully steerable telescope was a research and development radio/radar antenna that
           was part of the NASA Deep Space Network.  It was first operational in 1962 with a 26-m
           aperture and was named "Venus Station" to commemorate the first radar detection of Venus
           by radar facilities at Goldstone in 1961.  The 26-m antenna was decommissioned in 1991.
           Its cordinates are not known. A 34-m beam waveguide (BWG) antenna was completed in 1991
           at the same general location.  It was given the DSS-13 identifier and was used to 
           contnue research and development work at higher frequencies.
