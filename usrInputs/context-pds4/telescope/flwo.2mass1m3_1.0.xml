        The 2MASS 1.3m Telescope is a 1.3 m telescope located at 31.680780, 249.121860 at the Fred L. Whipple Observatory.
        
        The 2MASS project was carried out with two identical 1.3-meter aperture, open-tube, equatorial fork-mount telescopes. These telescopes have been provided with a Cassegrain focus mount for the infrared cameras and a secondary mirror, which is articulated in the declination direction.  The telescope described here is the northern hemisphere one, located at the Whipple Observatory in Arizona.

Primary Mirror: 1300 mm diameter, radius 5200 mm, conic constant -1.000
Secondary Mirror: 232 mm diameter, radius 965.7 mm, conic constant -1.847

The telescopes were designed, manufactured, and installed by M3 Engineering and Technology Corp., Tucson, AZ. The optics were figured by Rayleigh Optical Corp., Baltimore, MD. The telescope control system software was provided by Comsoft, Tucson, AZ. After the completion of the 2MASS data-taking, the University of Massachusetts donated the telescopes to the host observatories.
