           DSS-27 is one of two high-speed beam waveguide (HSB) antennas constructed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
           at the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex (GDSCC) for the U.S. Army; they were transferred to
           NASA in 1994. The beam waveguide (BWG) design moves environmentally sensitive electronic equipment from a
           cone at the reflector focus into a pedestal. The radio signal is guided from the subreflector through a 
           hole in the surface of the dish to the receiving equipment in the pedestal via a system of reflecting 
           mirrors inside a large tube. The reverse path allows transmission. The BWG design reduces weight on the 
           reflecting surface, provides insulation of electronics from environmental factors including dish movement,
           and simplifies maintenance.  The HSB antenna differs from other BWG antennas in that the pedestal room is
           above ground level (rather than underground), the optics design is different, and the subreflector does 
           not focus automatically for the purpose of maintaining gain as the elevation angle of the antenna changes.
           The HSB antenna has higher tracking rates than do other BWG antennas; thus, it is an appropriate antenna
           to use when tracking Earth-orbiting satellites.  DSS-27 was decommissioned in the mid-2010s.  When 
           operational it could transmit 50-200 W at 2.1 GHz and receive right- or left-circularly polarized signals
           at 2.2 GHz.
