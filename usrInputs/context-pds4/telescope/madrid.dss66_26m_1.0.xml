                This reference is to a PDS collection containing several versions of the NASA Deep 
                Space Network (DSN) Telecommunications Link Design Handbook (Document 810-005).
                The Handbook is maintained in a modular format to provide interface 
                design data to flight projects using the DSN.  Modules are updated as appropriate.
                Each member product in the PDS collection is the set of modules as they applied
                at that point in time.  Modules include:

            DSS-66 was used primarily for communication with Earth orbiting spacecraft and for
            initial acquisition of any spacecraft immediately after launch. It partnered with
            DSS-16 (at Goldstone, CA) and DSS-46 (near Canberra, Australia) in a 26-m subnet
            for this purpose.  DSS-66 could transmit 50-2000 W at 2.1 GHz (S-band).  It could receive 
            right- and left-circularly polarized signals simultaneously at both 2.3 GHz and 8.4 GHz; 
            its receiver could combine the signals to obtain a rotatable linear polization.
            The antenna became operational in 1966, was moved from the nearby Fresnedillas NASA
            tracking site to its present location in 1983, and was decommissioned in 2009.
            
            The Madrid Deep Space Communications Complex (MDSCC) is located about 65 km west of Madrid,
            near the town of Robledo de Chevala, Spain.  Under an agreement between the governments of
            Spain and the United States, dated 1964-01-29, the National Institute for Aerospace 
            Technology (INTA) and the U.S. space agency NASA signed a contract for operation and 
            maintenance of the MDSCC facilities. The creation, in 1992, of the state-owned Aerospace 
            Engineering and Services, SA (INSA, S.A.) under INTA, allowed the concentration of these 
            responsibilities in the new company. INSA has disappeared and Ingeniería de Sistemas para
            la Defensa de España is the company that has managed MDSCC since December 2012.
