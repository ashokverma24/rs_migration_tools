                This reference is to a PDS collection containing several versions of the NASA Deep 
                Space Network (DSN) Telecommunications Link Design Handbook (Document 810-005).
                The Handbook is maintained in a modular format to provide interface 
                design data to flight projects using the DSN.  Modules are updated as appropriate.
                Each member product in the PDS collection is the set of modules as they applied
                at that point in time.  Modules include:

            This 26-meter (85-ft.) diameter antenna was originally designed as part of the Manned Space Flight 
            Network (MSFN), managed by Goddard Space Flight Center. At the completion of the Apollo missions,
            DSS-16 was designated a part of the Satellite Tracking and Data Network (STDN) and used 
            for tracking Earth orbiting satellites and for initial acquisition of any spacecraft immediately 
            after launch. It partnered with DSS-46 (near Canberra, Australia) and DSS-66 (near Madrid, Spain)
            in a 26-m subnet for this purpose.  In the 1990s it provided communications with NASA's Space 
            Shuttle.  DSS-16 could transmit 50-2000 W at 2.1 GHz (S-band).  It could receive right- and 
            left-circularly polarized signals simultaneously at both 2.3 GHz and 8.4 GHz; its receiver could
            combine the signals to obtain a rotatable linear polization. The antenna was completed in 1966 
            and remained part of NASA's tracking networks until the mid-2000s.
