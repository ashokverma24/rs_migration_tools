                This reference is to a PDS collection containing several versions of the NASA Deep 
                Space Network (DSN) Telecommunications Link Design Handbook (Document 810-005).
                The Handbook is maintained in a modular format to provide interface 
                design data to flight projects using the DSN.  Modules are updated as appropriate.
                Each member product in the PDS collection is the set of modules as they applied
                at that point in time.  Modules include:

            NOTE: The telescope was physically moved in February-September 2005; these coordinates and this

            This fully steerable telescope was a dual-shaped reflector radio antenna that was part of the 
            NASA Deep Space Network.  It was first operational in 1987 with a 34-m aperture; it is expected
            to be decommissioned in 2021.  When operational, the antenna could receive at frequencies
            in the range 2.0-8.6 GHz in right- or left-circular polarization (but not simultaneously).
            It could transmit 50-250 W at 2.1 GHz or up to 20 kW at 7.1 GHz. Antenna coordinates were 
            converted from Table 5 in module 301 (revision L) of the DSN Telecommunications Link Design 
            Handbook (DSN document 810-005). 
            
            The Madrid Deep Space Communications Complex (MDSCC) is located about 65 km west of Madrid,
            near the town of Robledo de Chevala, Spain.  Under an agreement between the governments of
            Spain and the United States, dated 1964-01-29, the National Institute for Aerospace 
            Technology (INTA) and the U.S. space agency NASA signed a contract for operation and 
            maintenance of the MDSCC facilities. The creation, in 1992, of the state-owned Aerospace 
            Engineering and Services, SA (INSA, S.A.) under INTA, allowed the concentration of these 
            responsibilities in the new company. INSA has disappeared and Ingeniería de Sistemas para 
            la Defensa de España is the company that has managed MDSCC since December 2012.
