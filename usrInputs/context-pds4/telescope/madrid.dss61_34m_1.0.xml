                This reference is to a PDS collection containing several versions of the NASA Deep 
                Space Network (DSN) Telecommunications Link Design Handbook (Document 810-005).
                The Handbook is maintained in a modular format to provide interface 
                design data to flight projects using the DSN.  Modules are updated as appropriate.
                Each member product in the PDS collection is the set of modules as they applied
                at that point in time.  Modules include:

                This context product provides more information on the commanding, radio tracking, and
                radio science instrumentation at the telescope.  Only information appropriate to years
                2000 and earlier would be applicable to DSS-61 operations.

                This document provides DSN station coordinates which are required for spacecraft 
                navigation and location of stations with respect to other points on the Earth's 
                surface.  This document is a precursor to Module 301 in DSN document 810-005, the
                DSN Telecommunication Link Design Handbook, which was issued in its current form
                (as Rev. E) on 2001-01-15.

            Deep Space Station 61 (DSS-61) is located at the Madrid Deep Space Communications Complex (MDSCC)
            near Madrid, Spain.  It became part of the NASA Deep Space Network in the mid 1960s.  Its original
            diameter was 26-m, but that was extended to 34-m in the 1980s.  DSS-61 was decommissioned in
            1999 and transferred to the PARTNeR Project (for educational purposes) in 2001.
            
            The Madrid Deep Space Communications Complex (MDSCC) is located about 65 km west of Madrid,
            near the town of Robledo de Chevala, Spain.  Under an agreement between the governments of Spain
            and the United States, dated 1964-01-29, the National Institute for Aerospace 
            Technology (INTA) and the U.S. space agency NASA signed a contract for operation and 
            maintenance of the MDSCC facilities. The creation, in 1992, of the state-owned Aerospace 
            Engineering and Services, SA (INSA, S.A.) under INTA, allowed the concentration of these 
            responsibilities in the new company. INSA has disappeared and Ingeniería de Sistemas para la
            Defensa de España is the company that has managed MDSCC since December 2012.
