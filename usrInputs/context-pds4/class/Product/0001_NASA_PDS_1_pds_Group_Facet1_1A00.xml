        <definition>The Group_Facet1 class contains a single facet restricted according to the value of discipline_name. It also contains zero or more subfacets restricted according to the value of the facet. Note that Science_Facets was modeled with Discipline_Facets as a component and Discipline_Facets was modeled with Group_Facet1 and Group_Facet2 as components. This dependency hierarchy was flattened and only Science_Facets exists in the schema.</definition>
