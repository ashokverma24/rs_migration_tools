  Instrument Host Overview                                                    
  ========================                                                    
    Apollo 17 Command and Service Module (CSM) was the sixth and last         
    crewed vehicle to orbit on the Moon as part of NASA's Apollo program.     
    It was piloted by astronaut Ronald E. Evans.                              
                                                                              
    Spacecraft and Subsystems                                                 
    -------------------------                                                 
      As the name implies, the Command and Service Module (CSM) was comprised 
      of two distinct units: the Command Module (CM), which housed the crew,  
      spacecraft operations systems, and re-entry equipment, and the Service  
      Module (SM) which carried most of the consumables (oxygen, water,       
      helium, fuel cells, and fuel) and the main propulsion system. The total 
      length of the two modules attached was 11.0 meters with a maximum       
      diameter of 3.9 meters. Block II CSM's were used for all the crewed     
      Apollo missions. Apollo 17 was the third of the Apollo J-series         
      spacecraft. The launch mass, including propellants and expendables, of  
      the Apollo 17 CSM was 30,320 kg of which the Command Module (CM-114) had
      a mass of 5960 kg and the Service Module (SM-114) 24,360 kg. The Apollo 
      17 CM capsule 'America' is on display at the Johnson Space Center in    
      Houston, Texas.                                                         
                                                                              
      Telecommunications included voice, television, data, and tracking and   
      ranging subsystems for communications between astronauts, CM, LM, and   
      Earth. Voice contact was provided by an S-band uplink and downlink      
      system. Tracking was done through a unified S-band transponder. A high  
      gain steerable S-band antenna consisting of four 79-cm diameter         
      parabolic dishes was mounted on a folding boom at the aft end of the SM.
      Two VHF scimitar antennas were also mounted on the SM. There was also a 
      VHF recovery beacon mounted in the CM. The CSM environmental control    
      system regulated cabin atmosphere, pressure, temperature, carbon        
      dioxide, odors, particles, and ventilation and controlled the           
      temperature range of the electronic equipment.                          
                                                                              
    Command Module                                                            
    --------------                                                            
      The CM was a conical pressure vessel with a maximum diameter of 3.9     
      meters at its base and a height of 3.65 meters. It was made of an       
      aluminum honeycomb sandwich bonded between sheet aluminum alloy. The    
      base of the CM consisted of a heat shield made of brazed stainless steel
      honeycomb filled with a phenolic epoxy resin as an ablative material and
      varied in thickness from 1.8 to 6.9 centimeters. At the tip of the cone 
      was a hatch and docking assembly designed to mate with the lunar module.
      The CM was divided into three compartments. The forward compartment in  
      the nose of the cone held the three 25.4 meters diameter main           
      parachutes, two 5 meter drogue parachutes, and pilot mortar chutes for  
      Earth landing. The aft compartment was situated around the base of the  
      CM and contained propellant tanks, reaction control engines, wiring, and
      plumbing. The crew compartment comprised most of the volume of the CM,  
      approximately 6.17 cubic meters of space. Three astronaut couches were  
      lined up facing forward in the center of the compartment. A large access
      hatch was situated above the center couch. A short access tunnel led to 
      the docking hatch in the CM nose. The crew compartment held the         
      controls, displays, navigation equipment and other systems used by the  
      astronauts. The CM had five windows: one in the access hatch, one next  
      to each astronaut in the two outer seats, and two forward-facing        
      rendezvous windows. Five silver/zinc-oxide batteries provided power     
      after the CM and SM detached, three for re-entry and after landing and  
      two for vehicle separation and parachute deployment. The CM had twelve  
      420-Newton nitrogen tetroxide/hydrazine reaction control thrusters. The 
      CM provided the re-entry capability at the end of the mission after     
      separation from the Service Module.                                     
                                                                              
    Service Module                                                            
    --------------                                                            
      The SM was a cylinder 3.9 meters in diameter and 7.6 meters long which  
      was attached to the back of the CM. The outer skin of the SM was formed 
      of 2.5 cm thick aluminum honeycomb panels. The interior was divided by  
      milled aluminum radial beams into six sections around a central         
      cylinder. At the back of the SM mounted in the central cylinder was a   
      gimbal mounted re-startable hypergolic liquid propellant 91,000 Newton  
      engine and cone shaped engine nozzle. Attitude control was provided by  
      four identical banks of four 450 Newton reaction control thrusters each 
      spaced 90 degrees apart around the forward part of the SM. The six      
      sections of the SM held three 31-cell hydrogen oxygen fuel cells which  
      provided 28 volts, an auxiliary battery, three cryogenic oxygen and     
      three cryogenic hydrogen tanks, four tanks for the main propulsion      
      engine, two for fuel and two for oxidizer, the subsystems the main      
      propulsion unit, and a Scientific Instrument Module (SIM) bay which held
      a package of science instruments and cameras to be operated from lunar  
      orbit. Two helium tanks were mounted in the central cylinder. Electrical
      power system radiators were at the top of the cylinder and environmental
      control radiator panels spaced around the bottom.                       
                                                                              
    Scientific Experiments                                                    
    ----------------------                                                    
      The following scientific experiments were performed on board the        
      Apollo 17 Command and Service Module:                                   
                                                                              
      - The Handheld Photography Experiment included Hasselblad and Maurer    
        cameras that were used (1) to obtain photographs of the               
        transposition, docking, lunar module ejection maneuver, and LM        
        rendezvous sequence from both the command and lunar modules, (2) to   
        obtain photographs of the lunar ground track and of future landing    
        sites, (3) to record the operational activities of the crew, (4) to   
        obtain long-distance earth and lunar photographs for areas of         
        scientific interest, and (5) to obtain photos of lunar surface        
        features and of the activities of the astronauts after their          
        landing on the Moon.                                                  
                                                                              
      - The Panoramic Photography Experiment obtained high-resolution         
        panoramic photographs with stereoscopic and monoscopic coverage of    
        the lunar surface using a panoramic camera.                           
                                                                              
      - The Metric Photography Experiment obtained high-quality metric        
        photographs of the lunar surface and stellar photographs exposed      
        simultaneously with the metric photographs.                           
                                                                              
      - The Mapping Camera Aspect Stellar Photography was part of the         
        mapping camera subsystem which provided cartographic pointing         
        references for the metric camera through the use of the star field    
        photographed.                                                         
                                                                              
      - The Laser Altimeter Experiment obtained data on the altitude of the   
        CSM above the lunar surface to support mapping and panoramic camera   
        photography, to provide altitude data for other orbital               
        experiments, and to relate lunar topographical features for a         
        better definition of lunar shape.                                     
                                                                              
      - The Far-Ultraviolet Spectrometer Experiment measured from orbit       
        the composition of the lunar atmosphere in a spectral range           
        from 1180 to 1680 Angstrom. Additional observations were made         
        of the lunar surface, zodiacal light, solar atmosphere                
        emissions, earth emissions, and galactic and stellar emissions.       
                                                                              
      - The Infrared Scanning Radiometer mapped from orbit the thermal        
        emission from the lunar surface to produce a high-resolution          
        surface temperature map.                                              
                                                                              
      - The Lunar Sounder Experiment, used synthetic aperture radar to        
        (1) map the subsurface electrical conductivity structure of           
        the upper kilometer of the lunar crust to infer geological            
        structure, (2) make surface profiles to determine lunar               
        topographic variations, (3) produce surface imaging, and (4)          
        measure galactic electromagnetic radiation in the lunar               
        environment.                                                          
                                                                              
      - The S-Band Transponder Experiment measured the lunar gravitational    
        field by observing the dynamical motion of the spacecraft in free     
        fall orbits to provide information about the distribution of lunar    
        mass.                                                                 
                                                                              
      - The Window Meteoroid Detector Experiment used the CM heat shield      
        window surfaces (fused silica) to obtain information about the flux   
        of meteoroids with masses of 1 nanogram or less.  About 0.4 square    
        meters of the window surfaces were used as meteoroid impact           
        detectors.                                                            
                                                                              
      - The Biological Cosmic Ray Experiment (BIOCORE) had the primary        
        scientific objective of determining if heavy cosmic ray               
        particles (stripped nuclei) injure the brain, eyes, skin, and         
        other tissues. The experiment consisted of a group of pocket          
        mice with cosmic ray detectors planted under their scalps             
        which were flown aboard the CM in a special container.                
                                                                              
      - The Biostack Experiment used a hermetically sealed aluminum           
        container containing a series of monolayers of selected biologic      
        material to study the effects of high-energy/high-Z particles on a    
        broad spectrum of biologic systems from the molecular to the          
        highly organized and developed forms of life.                         
                                                                              
      - The Heat Flow and Convection experiment was an engineering test       
        performed on board the CM to measure and observe the behavior         
        of fluid flowing in the absence of gravity.                           
                                                                              
      - The Light Flashes Experiment studied light flashes seen by the crew
