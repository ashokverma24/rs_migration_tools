     Instrument Overview
    ===================

      The gravity science instrument utilizes the X and Ka-band transponders
      on-board the Juno spacecraft and Doppler tracking equipment at
      the Deep Space Network to perform radio science investigations
      to determine the gravitational field of celestial bodies.
      The spacecraft part of the radio science instrument is
      described immediately below; that is followed by a description
      of the DSN (ground) part of the instrument. For more
      information about the Juno spacecraft and mission, see
      [MATOUSEK2006].

    Instrument Overview - Spacecraft
    ================================
      
        The Juno telecommunications system operates at X-band and Ka-band
        to support the gravity science investigation at Jupiter. The
        X-band transponder onboard the spacecraft provides the primary
        communications and telemetry with the ground station. The
        Ka-band telemetry system is augmented with a Ka-band Translator
        and downconverter enabling a two-way Ka-band radio science link
        to the Deep Space Network. The X-band and Ka-band systems can be
        operated simultaneously for dual X-up/X-down and Ka-up/Ka-down.
        The ground station uplinks a carrier to the spacecraft which
        the receiver acquires and tracks. The spacecraft then transmits
        a signal that is coherent with the uplink signal received. When
        no uplink signal is present, the downlink signal was
        referenced to the auxiliary oscillator. Data that are
        noncoherent contains too much Doppler noise to be useful
        for gravity science.

    Science Objectives
    ==================
      The radio tracking data are used to improve knowledge of
      the magnitude and direction of Jupiter's gravity field.
      The analysis of the interplanetary tracking data (both
      range data and VLBI) to Juno can be used to improve the
      modeling of the orbit of Jupiter in future versions of the
      solar system planetary ephemerides.

      Gravity Measurements
      --------------------

        Measurement of the gravity field provides significant
        constraints on inferences about the interior structure of
        Jupiter. Precise, detailed study of the spacecraft motion
        in Jovian orbit can yield the mass distribution of the
        gas giant.

        Studies of the gravity field emphasize both the global
        field and local characteristics of the field. The first
        task is to determine the global field. Doppler and range
        tracking measurements yield accurate spacecraft trajectory
        solutions. Simultaneously with reconstruction of the
        spacecraft orbit, observation equations for field
        coefficients and a small number of ancillary parameters
        can be solved. This type of gravity field solution is
        essential for characterizing tectonic phenomena and can
        also be used to study localized features.

        'Short-arc' line-of-sight Doppler tracking measurements
        obtained when the Earth-to-spacecraft line-of-sight is
        within a few degrees of the orbit plane provide the
        highest resolution of local features. The results from
        this type of observation typically are presented as
        contoured acceleration profiles of specific features
        (e.g., craters, volcanoes, etc.) or line-of-sight
        acceleration maps of specific regions.


    Operational Considerations - Spacecraft
    =======================================
        Ka-band measurements are only available when the onboard
        Ka-band Translator is powered on. Ka-band uplink/downlink
        is available when the spacecraft is being tracked by 
        the Deep Space Network's DSS-25 in Goldstone, CA because
        it is the only station in the network with a Ka-band
        transmitter. During Ka-band tracks not over DSS-25, only
        non-coherent Ka-band or Ka-band referenced to the X-band
        uplink is available.

        During the capture orbit phase, Ka-band checkout passes
        were conducted to ensure operational status of the Ka-band
        equipment onboard the spacecraft. 

        Science phase perijoves are all conducted over the DSS-25
        antenna in Goldstone, CA. Only X-band data are available
        for MWR perijoves. Ka-band and X-band data are available
        for GRAV perijoves. See the MISSION.CAT for details on
        perijove types and dates.

    Instrument Overview - DSN
    =========================
      Three Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) (near
      Barstow, CA; Canberra, Australia; and Madrid, Spain) comprise
      the DSN tracking network.  Each complex is equipped with
      several antennas [including at least one each 70-m, 34-m High
      Efficiency (HEF), and 34-m Beam WaveGuide (BWG)], associated
      electronics, and operational systems.  Primary activity
      at each complex is radiation of commands to and reception of
      telemetry data from active spacecraft.  Transmission and
      reception is possible in several radio-frequency bands, the
      most common being S-band (nominally a frequency of 2100-2300
      MHz or a wavelength of 14.2-13.0 cm) and X-band (7100-8500 MHz
      or 4.2-3.5 cm).  Transmitter output powers of up to 400 kW are
      available.

      Ground stations have the ability to transmit coded and uncoded
      waveforms which can be echoed by distant spacecraft.  Analysis
      of the received coding allows navigators to determine the
      distance to the spacecraft; analysis of Doppler shift on the
      carrier signal allows estimation of the line-of-sight
      spacecraft velocity.  Range and Doppler measurements are used
      to calculate the spacecraft trajectory and to infer gravity
      fields of objects near the spacecraft.

      Ground stations can record spacecraft signals that have
      propagated through or been scattered from target media.
      Measurements of signal parameters after wave interactions with
      surfaces, atmospheres, rings, and plasmas are used to infer
      physical and electrical properties of the target.

      Principal investigators vary from experiment to experiment.
      See the corresponding section of the spacecraft instrument
      description or the data set description for specifics.

      The Deep Space Network is managed by the Jet Propulsion
      Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology for the
      U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

    Subsystems - DSN
    ================
      The Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) are an integral
      part of Radio Science instrumentation, along with the
      spacecraft Radio Frequency Subsystem.  Their system performance
      directly determines the degree of success of Radio Science
      investigations, and their system calibration determines the
      degree of accuracy in the results of the experiments.  The
      following paragraphs describe the functions performed by the
      individual subsystems of a DSCC.  This material has been
      adapted from [ASMARETAL1995]; for additional
      information, consult [DSN810-5].

      Each DSCC includes a set of antennas, a Signal Processing
      Center (SPC), and communication links to the Jet Propulsion
      Laboratory (JPL).  The general configuration is illustrated
      below; antennas (Deep Space Stations, or DSS -- a term carried
      over from earlier times when antennas were individually
      instrumented) are listed in the table.

      Subsystem interconnections at each DSCC are shown in the
      diagram below, and they are described in the sections that

      DSCC Monitor and Control Subsystem
      ----------------------------------
        The DSCC Monitor and Control Subsystem (DMC) is part of the
        Monitor and Control System (MON) which also includes the
        ground communications Central Communications Terminal and the
        Network Operations Control Center (NOCC) Monitor and Control
        Subsystem.  The DMC is the center of activity at a DSCC.  The
        DMC receives and archives most of the information from the
        NOCC needed by the various DSCC subsystems during their
        operation.  Control of most of the DSCC subsystems, as well
        as the handling and displaying of any responses to control
        directives and configuration and status information received
        from each of the subsystems, is done through the DMC.  The
        effect of this is to centralize the control, display, and
        archiving functions necessary to operate a DSCC.
        Communication among the various subsystems is done using a
        Local Area Network (LAN) hooked up to each subsystem via a
        network interface unit (NIU).


      DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem
      ---------------------------------
        Multi-mission Radio Science activities require support from
        the 70-m, 34-m HEF, and 34-m BWG antenna subnets.  The
        antennas at each DSCC function as large-aperture collectors
        which, by double reflection, cause the incoming radio
        frequency (RF) energy to enter the feed horns.  The large
        collecting surface of the antenna focuses the incoming energy
        onto a subreflector, which is adjustable in both axial and
        angular position.  These adjustments are made to correct for
        gravitational deformation of the antenna as it moves between
        zenith and the horizon; the deformation can be as large as
        5 cm.  The subreflector adjustments optimize the channeling
        of energy from the primary reflector to the subreflector
        and then to the feed horns.  The 70-m and 34-m HEF antennas
        have 'shaped' primary and secondary reflectors, with forms
        that are modified paraboloids.  This customization allows
        more uniform illumination of one reflector by another.  The
        BWG reflector shape is ellipsoidal.

        On the 70-m antennas, the subreflector directs
        received energy from the antenna onto a dichroic plate, a
        device which reflects S-band energy to the S-band feed horn
        and passes X-band energy through to the X-band feed horn.  In
        the 34-m HEF, there is one 'common aperture feed,' which
        accepts both frequencies without requiring a dichroic plate.
        In the 34-m BWG, a series of small mirrors (approximately 2.5
        meters in diameter) directs microwave energy from the
        subreflector region to a collection area at the base of
        the antenna -- typically in a pedestal room.  A retractable
        dichroic reflector separates S- and X-band on some BWG
        antennas or X- and Ka-band on others.  RF energy to be
        transmitted into space by the horns is focused by the
        reflectors into narrow cylindrical beams, pointed with high
        precision (either to the dichroic plate or directly to the
        subreflector) by a series of drive motors and gear trains
        that can rotate the movable components and their support
        structures.

        The different antennas can be pointed by several means.  Two
        pointing modes commonly used during tracking passes are
        CONSCAN and 'blind pointing.' With CONSCAN enabled and a
        closed loop receiver locked to a spacecraft signal, the
        system tracks the radio source by conically scanning around
        its position in the sky.  Pointing angle adjustments are
        computed from signal strength information (feedback) supplied
        by the receiver.  In this mode the Antenna Pointing Assembly
        (APA) generates a circular scan pattern which is sent to the
        Antenna Control System (ACS).  The ACS adds the scan pattern
        to the corrected pointing angle predicts.  Software in the
        receiver-exciter controller computes the received signal
        level and sends it to the APA.  The correlation of scan
        position with the received signal level variations allows the
        APA to compute offset changes which are sent to the ACS.
        Thus, within the capability of the closed-loop control
        system, the scan center is pointed precisely at the apparent
        direction of the spacecraft signal source.  An additional
        function of the APA is to provide antenna position angles and
        residuals, antenna control mode/status information, and
        predict-correction parameters to the Area Routing Assembly
        (ARA) via the LAN, which then sends this information to JPL
        via the Ground Communications Facility (GCF) for antenna
        status monitoring.

        During periods when excessive signal level dynamics or low
        received signal levels are expected (e.g., during an
        occultation experiment), CONSCAN should not be used.  Under
        these conditions, blind pointing (CONSCAN OFF) is used, and
        pointing angle adjustments are based on a predetermined
        Systematic Error Correction (SEC) model.

        Independent of CONSCAN state, subreflector motion in at least
        the z-axis may introduce phase variations into the received
        Radio Science data.  For that reason, during certain
        experiments, the subreflector in the 70-m and 34-m HEFs may
        be frozen in the z-axis at a position (often based on
        elevation angle) selected to minimize phase change and signal
        degradation.  This can be done via Operator Control Inputs
        (OCIs) from the LMC to the Subreflector Controller (SRC)
        which resides in the alidade room of the antennas.  The SRC
        passes the commands to motors that drive the subreflector to
        the desired position.

        Pointing angles for all antenna types are computed by
        the NOCC Support System (NSS) from an ephemeris provided by
        the flight project.  These predicts are received and archived
        by the CMC.  Before each track, they are transferred to the
        APA, which transforms the direction cosines of the predicts
        into AZ-EL coordinates.  The LMC operator then downloads the
        antenna predict points to the antenna-mounted ACS computer
        along with a selected SEC model.  The pointing predicts
        consist of time-tagged AZ-EL points at selected time
        intervals along with polynomial coefficients for
        interpolation between points.

        The ACS automatically interpolates the predict points,
        corrects the pointing predicts for refraction and
        subreflector position, and adds the proper systematic error
        correction and any manually entered antenna offsets.  The ACS
        then sends angular position commands for each axis at the
        rate of one per second.  In the 70-m and 34-m HEF, rate
        commands are generated from the position commands at the
        servo controller and are subsequently used to steer the
        antenna.

        When not using binary predicts (the routine mode for
        spacecraft tracking), the antennas can be pointed using
        'planetary mode' -- a simpler mode which uses right ascension
        (RA) and declination (DEC) values.  These change very slowly
        with respect to the celestial frame.  Values are provided to
        the station in text form for manual entry.  The ACS
        quadratically interpolates among three RA and DEC points
        which are on one-day centers.

        A third pointing mode -- sidereal -- is available for
        tracking radio sources fixed with respect to the celestial
        frame.

        Regardless of the pointing mode being used, a 70-m antenna
        has a special high-accuracy pointing capability called
        'precision' mode.  A pointing control loop derives the
        main AZ-EL pointing servo drive error signals from a two-
        axis autocollimator mounted on the Intermediate Reference
        Structure.  The autocollimator projects a light beam to a
        precision mirror mounted on the Master Equatorial drive
        system, a much smaller structure, independent of the main
        antenna, which is exactly positioned in HA and DEC with shaft
        encoders.  The autocollimator detects elevation/cross-
        elevation errors between the two reference surfaces by
        measuring the angular displacement of the reflected light
        beam.  This error is compensated for in the antenna servo by
        moving the antenna in the appropriate AZ-EL direction.
        Pointing accuracies of 0.004 degrees (15 arc seconds) are
        possible in 'precision' mode.  The 'precision' mode is not
        available on 34-m antennas -- nor is it needed, since their
        beamwidths are twice as large as on the 70-m antennas.


      DSCC Antenna Microwave Subsystem
      --------------------------------
        70-m Antennas: Each 70-m antenna has three feed cones
        installed in a structure at the center of the main reflector.
        The feeds are positioned 120 degrees apart on a circle.
        Selection of the feed is made by rotation of the
        subreflector.  A dichroic mirror assembly, half on the S-band
        cone and half on the X-band cone, permits simultaneous use of
        the S- and X-band frequencies.  The third cone is devoted to
        R and D and more specialized work.

        The Antenna Microwave Subsystem (AMS) accepts the received S-
        and X-band signals at the feed horn and transmits them
        through polarizer plates to an orthomode transducer.  The
        polarizer plates are adjusted so that the signals are
        directed to a pair of redundant amplifiers for each
        frequency, thus allowing simultaneous reception of signals in
        two orthogonal polarizations.  For S-band these are two Block
        IVA S-band Traveling Wave Masers (TWMs); for X-band the
        amplifiers are Block IIA TWMs.

        34-m HEF Antennas:  The 34-m HEF uses a single feed for both
        S- and X-band.  Simultaneous S- and X-band receive as well as
        X-band transmit is possible thanks to the presence of an S/X
        'combiner' which acts as a diplexer.  For S-band, RCP or LCP
        is user selected through a switch so neither a polarizer nor
        an orthomode transducer is needed.  X-band amplification
        options include two Block II TWMs or an HEMT Low Noise
        Amplifier (LNA).  S-band amplification is provided by an FET
        LNA.

        34-m BWG Antennas: These antennas use feeds and low-noise
        amplifiers (LNA) in the pedestal room, which can be switched
        in and out as needed.  Typically the following modes are
        available:
           1. downlink non-diplexed path (RCP or LCP) to LNA-1, with
              uplink in the opposite circular polarization;
           2. downlink non-diplexed path (RCP or LCP) to LNA-2, with
              uplink in the opposite circular polarization
           3. downlink diplexed path (RCP or LCP) to LNA-1, with
              uplink in the same circular polarization
           4. downlink diplexed path (RCP or LCP) to LNA-2, with
              uplink in the same circular polarization
        For BWG antennas with dual-band capabilities (e.g., DSS 25)
        and dual LNAs, each of the above four modes can be used in a
        single-frequency or dual-frequency configuration.  Thus, for
        antennas with the most complete capabilities, there are
        sixteen possible ways to receive at a single frequency
        (2 polarizations, 2 waveguide path choices, 2 LNAs, and 2
        bands).


      DSCC Receiver-Exciter Subsystem
      -------------------------------
        The Receiver-Exciter Subsystem is composed of two groups of
        equipment: the closed-loop receiver group and the open-loop
        receiver group.  This subsystem is controlled by the
        Receiver-Exciter Controller (REC) which communicates
        directly with the DMC for predicts and OCI reception and
        status reporting.

        The exciter generates the S-band signal (or X-band for the
        34-m HEF only) which is provided to the Transmitter Subsystem
        for the spacecraft uplink signal.  It is tunable under
        command of the Digitally Controlled Oscillator (DCO) which
        receives predicts from the Metric Data Assembly (MDA).

        The diplexer in the signal path between the transmitter and
        the feed horn for all three antennas (used for simultaneous
        transmission and reception) may be configured such that it is
        out of the received signal path (in listen-only or bypass
        mode) in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the
        receiver system.

        Closed Loop Receivers: The Block V receiver-exciter at the
        70-m stations allows for two receiver channels, each capable
        of L-Band (e.g., 1668 MHz frequency or 18 cm wavelength),
        S-band, or X-band reception, and an S-band exciter for
        generation of uplink signals through the low-power or
        high-power transmitter.

        The closed-loop receivers provide the capability for rapid
        acquisition of a spacecraft signal and telemetry lockup.  In
        order to accomplish acquisition within a short time, the
        receivers are predict driven to search for, acquire, and
        track the downlink automatically.  Rapid acquisition
        precludes manual tuning though that remains as a backup
        capability.  The subsystem utilizes FFT analyzers for rapid
        acquisition.  The predicts are NSS generated, transmitted to
        the CMC which sends them to the Receiver-Exciter Subsystem
        where two sets can be stored.  The receiver starts
        acquisition at uplink time plus one round-trip-light-time or
        at operator specified times.  The receivers may also be
        operated from the LMC without a local operator attending
        them.  The receivers send performance and status data,
        displays, and event messages to the LMC.

        Either the exciter synthesizer signal or the simulation
        (SIM) synthesizer signal is used as the reference for the
        Doppler extractor in the closed-loop receiver systems,
        depending on the spacecraft being tracked (and Project
        guidelines).  The SIM synthesizer is not ramped; instead it
        uses one constant frequency, the Track Synthesizer Frequency
        (TSF), which is an average frequency for the entire pass.

        The closed-loop receiver AGC loop can be configured to one
        of three settings: narrow, medium, or wide.  It will be
        configured such that the expected amplitude changes are
        accommodated with minimum distortion.  The loop bandwidth
        (2BLo) will be configured such that the expected phase
        changes can be accommodated while maintaining the best
        possible loop SNR.

        Open-Loop Receivers (OLR):  The OLR utilized a fixed first
        Local Oscillator (LO) frequency and a tunable second LO
        frequency to minimize phase noise and improve frequency
        stability.  The OLR consisted of an RF-to-IF downconverter
        located at the feed , an IF selection switch (IFS), and a
        Radio Science Receiver (RSR).  The RF-IF downconverters
        in the 70-m antennas were equipped for four IF channels:
        S-RCP, S-LCP, X-RCP, and X-LCP.  The 34-m HEF stations
        were equipped with a two-channel RF-IF: S-band and X-band.
        The IFS switched the IF input among the antennas.


      DSCC Transmitter Subsystem
      --------------------------
        The Transmitter Subsystem accepts the S-band frequency
        exciter signal from the Receiver-Exciter Subsystem exciter
        and amplifies it to the required transmit output level.  The
        amplified signal is routed via the diplexer through the feed
        horn to the antenna and then focused and beamed to the
        spacecraft.

        The Transmitter Subsystem power capabilities range from 18 kW
        to 400 kW.  Power levels above 18 kW are available only at
        70-m stations, however, 80 kW transmitters are being installed
        at the 34-m stations.

        The Ka-band Transmitter at DSS-25 transmits at 300 W using
        two combined Traveling Wave Tube Amplifiers (TWTAs).


      DSCC Tracking Subsystem
      -----------------------
        The Tracking Subsystem primary functions are to acquire and
        maintain communications with the spacecraft and to generate
        and format radiometric data containing Doppler and range.

        The DSCC Tracking Subsystem (DTK) receives the carrier
        signals and ranging spectra from the Receiver-Exciter
        Subsystem.  The Doppler cycle counts are counted, formatted,
        and transmitted to JPL in real time.  Ranging data are also
        transmitted to JPL in real time.  Also contained in these
        blocks is the AGC information from the Receiver-Exciter
        Subsystem.  The Radio Metric Data Conditioning Team (RMDCT)
        at JPL produces a Tracking and Navigation Service File (TNF),
        which contains Doppler and ranging data.

        In addition, the Tracking Subsystem receives from the CMC
        frequency predicts (used to compute frequency residuals and
        noise estimates), receiver tuning predicts (used to tune the
        closed-loop receivers), and uplink tuning predicts (used to
        tune the exciter).  From the LMC, it receives configuration
        and control directives as well as configuration and status
        information on the transmitter, microwave, and frequency and
        timing subsystems.

        The Metric Data Assembly (MDA) controls all of the DTK
        functions supporting the uplink and downlink activities.  The
        MDA receives uplink predicts and controls the uplink tuning
        by commanding the DCO.  The MDA also controls the Sequential
        Ranging Assembly (SRA).  It formats the Doppler and range
        measurements and provides them to the GCF for transmission to
        NOCC.

        The Sequential Ranging Assembly (SRA) measures the round trip
        light time (RTLT) of a radio signal traveling from a ground
        tracking station to a spacecraft and back.  From the RTLT,
        phase, and Doppler data, the spacecraft range can be
        determined.  A coded signal is modulated on an uplink carrier
        and transmitted to the spacecraft where it is detected and
        transponded back to the ground station.  As a result, the
        signal received at the tracking station is delayed by its
        round trip through space and shifted in frequency by the
        Doppler effect due to the relative motion between the
        spacecraft and the tracking station on Earth.


      DSCC Frequency and Timing Subsystem
      -----------------------------------
        The Frequency and Timing Subsystem (FTS) provides all
        frequency and timing references required by the other DSCC
        subsystems.  It contains four frequency standards of which
        one is prime and the other three are backups.  Selection of
        the prime standard is done via the CMC.  Of these four
        standards, two are hydrogen masers followed by clean-up loops
        (CUL) and two are cesium standards.  These four standards all
        feed the Coherent Reference Generator (CRG) which provides
        the frequency references used by the rest of the complex.  It
        also provides the frequency reference to the Master Clock
        Assembly (MCA) which in turn provides time to the Time
        Insertion and Distribution Assembly (TID) which provides UTC
        and SIM-time to the complex.

        JPL's ability to monitor the FTS at each DSCC is limited to
        the MDA calculated Doppler pseudo-residuals, the Doppler
        noise, the SSI, and to a system which uses the Global
        Positioning System (GPS).  GPS receivers at each DSCC receive
        a one-pulse-per-second pulse from the station's (hydrogen
        maser referenced) FTS and a pulse from a GPS satellite at
        scheduled times.  After compensating for the satellite signal
        delay, the timing offset is reported to JPL where a database
        is kept.  The clock offsets stored in the JPL database are
        given in microseconds; each entry is a mean reading of
        measurements from several GPS satellites and a time tag
        associated with the mean reading.  The clock offsets provided
        include those of SPC 10 relative to UTC (NIST), SPC 40
        relative to SPC 10, etc.

    Detectors - DSN
    ===============
      Nominal carrier tracking loop threshold noise bandwidth at
      X-band is 10 Hz.  Coherent (two-way) closed-loop
      system stability is shown in the table below:

            integration time            Doppler uncertainty
                 (secs)               (one sigma, microns/sec)
                 ------               ------------------------
                    10                            50
                    60                            20
                  1000                             4

      For the open-loop subsystem, signal detection is done in
      software.


    Calibration - DSN
    =================
      Calibrations of hardware systems are carried out periodically
      by DSN personnel; these ensure that systems operate at required
      performance levels -- for example, that antenna patterns,
      receiver gain, propagation delays, and Doppler uncertainties
      meet specifications.  No information on specific calibration
      activities is available.  Nominal performance specifications
      are shown in the tables above.  Additional information may be
      available in [DSN810-5].

      Prior to each tracking pass, station operators perform a series
      of calibrations to ensure that systems meet specifications for
      that operational period.  Included in these calibrations is
      measurement of receiver system temperature in the configuration
      to be employed during the pass.  Results of these calibrations
      are recorded in (hard copy) Controller's Logs for each pass.

      The nominal procedure for initializing open-loop receiver
      attenuator settings is described below.  In cases where widely
      varying signal levels are expected, the procedure may be
      modified in advance or real-time adjustments may be made to
      attenuator settings.


    Operational Considerations - DSN
    ================================
      The DSN is a complex and dynamic 'instrument.' Its performance
      for Radio Science depends on a number of factors from equipment
      configuration to meteorological conditions.  No specific
      information on 'operational considerations' can be given here.


    Operational Modes - DSN
    =======================

      DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem
      ---------------------------------
        Pointing of DSCC antennas may be carried out in several ways.
        For details see the subsection 'DSCC Antenna Mechanical
        Subsystem' in the 'Subsystem' section.  Binary pointing is
        the preferred mode for tracking spacecraft; pointing
        predicts are provided, and the antenna simply follows those.
        With CONSCAN, the antenna scans conically about the optimum
        pointing direction, using closed-loop receiver signal
        strength estimates as feedback.  In planetary mode, the
        system interpolates from three (slowly changing) RA-DEC
        target coordinates; this is 'blind' pointing since there is
        no feedback from a detected signal.  In sidereal mode, the
        antenna tracks a fixed point on the celestial sphere.  In
        'precision' mode, the antenna pointing is adjusted using an
        optical feedback system.  It is possible on most antennas to
        freeze z-axis motion of the subreflector to minimize phase
        changes in the received signal.


      DSCC Receiver-Exciter Subsystem
      -------------------------------
        The diplexer in the signal path between the transmitter and
        the feed horns on all antennas may be configured so
        that it is out of the received signal path in order to
        improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the receiver system.
        This is known as the 'listen-only' or 'bypass' mode.


      Closed-Loop Receiver AGC Loop
      -----------------------------
        The closed-loop receiver AGC loop can be configured to one of
        three settings: narrow, medium, or wide.  Ordinarily it is
        configured so that expected signal amplitude changes are
        accommodated with minimum distortion.  The loop bandwidth is
        ordinarily configured so that expected phase changes can be
        accommodated while maintaining the best possible loop SNR.


      Coherent vs. Non-Coherent Operation
      -----------------------------------
        The frequency of the signal transmitted from the spacecraft
        can generally be controlled in two ways -- by locking to a
        signal received from a ground station or by locking to an
        on-board oscillator.  These are known as the coherent (or
        'two-way') and non-coherent ('one-way') modes, respectively.
        Mode selection is made at the spacecraft, based on commands
        received from the ground.  When operating in the coherent
        mode, the transponder carrier frequency is derived from the
        received uplink carrier frequency with a 'turn-around ratio'
        typically of 880/749.  In the non-coherent mode, the
        downlink carrier frequency is derived from the spacecraft
        on-board crystal-controlled oscillator.  Either closed-loop
        or open-loop receivers (or both) can be used with either
        spacecraft frequency reference mode.  Closed-loop reception
        in two-way mode is usually preferred for routine tracking.
        Occasionally the spacecraft operates coherently while two
        ground stations receive the 'downlink' signal; this is
        sometimes known as the 'three-way' mode.


    Location - DSN
    ==============
      Station locations are documented in [DSN810-5].  Geocentric
      coordinates are summarized here.

    Measurement Parameters - DSN
    ============================
      Closed-loop data are recorded in Tracking and Navigation Service
      Files (TNFs), as well as certain other products such as the
      Orbit Data File (ODF).  The TNFs are comprised of SFDUs that
      have variable-length, variable-format records with mixed typing
      (i.e., can contain ASCII, integer, and floating-point items in
      a single record). These files all contain entries that include
      measurements of Doppler, Range, and signal strength, along with
      status and uplink frequency information.
