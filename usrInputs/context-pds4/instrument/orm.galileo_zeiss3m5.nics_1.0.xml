    <description>NICS (Near Infrared Camera Spectrometer) is the TNG infrared (0.9-2.5 micron)
multimode instrument which is based on a HgCdTe Hawaii 1024x1024 array. Its observing
capabilities include imaging (4.2' x 4.2' f.o.v.), high-throughput low resolution
spectroscopy (RS=50-500), medium resolution spectoscopy (max-R=2500), imaging
polarimetry, spectropolarimetry and, when coupled to the adaptive optics module,
nearly
diffraction limited imaging.

Long slit spectroscopic observations are performed by inserting a slit at the
entrance focal plane and a disperser (grism or prism) in the collimated beam. The
table here lists the slits available in NICS which, thanks to the refurbishment works
of Feb-Mar 2003, have now a very stable and repeatable positioning. All spectroscopic
modes make use of the LF camera with a scale of 0.25 arcsec/pixel.

NICS slits
Name   Width          Length
0.5    0.5" = 2 pix   4'
0.75   0.75" = 3 pix  4'
1.0    1.0" = 4 pix   4'
1.5    1.5" = 6 pix   4'
2.0    2.0" = 8 pix   4'

The instrument is equipped with one prism and a number of grism dispersers
whose main characteristics are listed in the table below. Note that the
grisms have a fairly constant dispersion (angstroms/pix) throughout the
spectrum and, therefore, their resolving power increases going towards the
red. The Amici prism, on the contrary, delivers a spectrum with a
quasi-constant resolving power and, therefore, its dispersion varies by more
than a factor of 3 over its spectral range.

All the low resolution dispersers can be used in combination with the grey
filters to take spectra of very bright objects which would otherwise saturate
the array.
