          The Neutron Spectrometer (NS) instrument formed part of the
          geochemistry investigation of the MESSENGER mission and yielded
          information about the elemental composition of the planet's
          surface. NS measured the flux of ejected neutrons in three energy
          ranges and was particularly sensitive to the H content of a body.
          Neutron measurements were used to infer the composition of
          Mercury's surface over localized regions using established
          techniques, such as used recently on the Lunar Prospector and Mars
          Odyssey missions.
          
          The NS sensor consisted of three scintillators, each wrapped
          separately and coupled to separate photo-multiplier tubes. The
          three scintillators were sensitive to neutrons of different
          energies: thermal neutrons (0.025 - 1 eV), epithermal neutrons (1
          eV - 500 keV), and fast neutrons (500 keV - 7 MeV). The first and
          third scintillators were lithium (6Li)-glass scintillators (LG1 and
          LG2) that respond to a combination of thermal and epithermal
          neutrons. The middle scintillator was a borated plastic (BP)
          scintillator that responded only to epithermal and fast neutrons
          due to its electronics setup. The interaction of galactic cosmic
          rays (GCR) with the surface of Mercury produces neutrons, some of
          which escape the surface and produce a neutron signal that can be
          measured by the orbiting NS sensor. The measured neutron energy
          spectrum reflects the transport properties of the surface
          composition and is sensitive to depths down to about 1 m. Thermal
          neutrons are sensitive to a variety of elements, including Fe, Ti,
          Gd, Sm, Cl, and C. Epithermal neutrons are mostly sensitive to H
          abundance. Fast neutrons can provide a good measure of average
          atomic mass. For the MESSENGER mission, the NS sensor mapped the
          abundance of H over most of the northern hemisphere of Mercury,
          providing significant new information regarding the potential
          presence of water ice within and near permanently shaded craters
          near the north pole.
