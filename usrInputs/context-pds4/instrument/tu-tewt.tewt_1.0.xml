            The Trent Environmental Wind Tunnel (TEWT) is a low-speed research facility designed for simulation of the atmospheric boundary 
            layer both in clean air and with sediment transport. The development of this facility has been completed entirely 'in-house' with 
            funds provided by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, the Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI) and 
            Trent University (TU-NSRC). In 1997, the tunnel was expanded and relocated to its present site within a climate controlled laboratory 
            in the Environmental Sciences Building. The Trent Environmental Wind Tunnel (TEWT) was established in 1997 with the purpose of studying
            the fluid mechanics of aeolian transport and the associated sediment erosion and deposition. TEWT is unique from most wind tunnels as 
            it allows full control over humidity and temperature (down to -10 OC). The working section of the wind tunnel (exclusive of fan and 
            intake bell) has the x, y, and z dimensions of 13.8 m x 0.71 m x 0.76 m.
