  Instrument Overview
  ===================
    The Lunar Prospector Radio Science investigations utilized
    instrumentation with elements on the spacecraft and at the DSN.
    Much of this was shared equipment, being used for routine
    telecommunications as well as for Radio Science.  The
    performance and calibration of both the spacecraft and tracking
    stations directly affected the radio science data accuracy, and
    played a major role in determining the quality of the results.
    The spacecraft part of the radio science instrument is
    described immediately below; that is followed by a description
    of the DSN (ground) part of the instrument.  More information
    on the Lunar Prospector radio science instrument and
    communication subsystem can be found in the Lunar Prospector
    Mission Handbook [ANDOLZ1998].
 
 
  Instrument Overview - Spacecraft
  ================================
 
    Communications System Overview
    ------------------------------
      The Lunar Prospector communication system provides a
      scientific data and telemetry link between the satellite and
      the ground.  Scientific data, health and status signals are
      transmitted at 2273.0 MHz over a +/- 1 MHz bandwidth with
      nominal power of 5 Watts and peak power of 7 Watts.  The
      radiated signal is right-hand circularly polarized (RCP).
      The command link is received at 2093.0542 MHz over a +/- 1
      MHz bandwidth.
 
 
    S-Band Transponder
    ------------------
      The Loral/Conic S-Band transponder is a standard, off the
      shelf, S-Band transponder that combines the receiver and
      transmitter into one unit.  The S-band transponder supports
      the essential communications functions needed for tracking,
      telemetry, and command of Lunar Prospector.  The transponder
      receives commands from the ground station along with signals
      inserted on the uplink for ranging purposes and transmits
      scientific data and telemetry from the spacecraft to the
      ground.
 
      The receiver/detector section of the transponder detects
      S-band uplink signals, demodulates the 250 bps lunar command
      signal, and outputs it as binary command data and bit timing
      to command and data handling.  Ranging signals are also
      demodulated and remodulated onto the downlink carrier to
      provide range information to ground equipment when desired.
      Ranging can be commanded ON or OFF.
 
      The transmitter/baseband section of the transponder receives
      data from the Command And Data Handling (C&amp;DH) electronics at
      a rate of 300 bps or 3600 bps, converts it from NRZ-L to
      NRZ-M format and then applies rate 1/2, k=7 convolutional
      encoding for error protection when convolutional encoding is
      enabled.  The encoded data BPSK modulates an internal 1.024
      MHz subcarrier which in turn phase modulates the downlink
      carrier for transmission to the ground station.
      Convolutional encoding can be commanded ON or OFF.
 
 
    Antenna System Overview
    -----------------------
      The Lunar Prospector antennas provide scientific data and
      telemetry links between the satellite and the ground.  Both
      antennas transmit and receive RCP over their main beams.
 
      The antenna used to complete the command and initial
      telemetry link is a conical spiral.  This antenna has an
      omnidirectional pattern from 0 to over 100 degrees from
      the +z (spin) axis of the spacecraft.  A gain of better than
      -1 dBi is achieved to angles 60 degrees from the +z axis,
      -3 dBi to angles 90 degrees from the +z axis, and -5 dBi to
      angles 100 degrees from the +z axis.  Spacecraft obstructions
      are not a factor until 148 degrees, where the antenna gain is
      approximately -15 dBi.
 
      Once LP reached lunar orbit, the scientific data and
      telemetry were transmitted by a medium gain antenna --
      a bifilar helix wrapped around a metal core.  The
      structural loads on the helix are eliminated by
      enclosing it in a radome/support structure.  This also
      supports the omni antenna on the top of the structure.
      The medium gain antenna beam is a fan extending from
      85 to 95 degrees from the +z (spin) axis of the spacecraft.
      For the 90 degree roll cut the maximum gain is 8.5 dBi and
      the minimum gain is 6.85 dBi.  The average gain is 7.75 dBi
      and the phase ripple is 13 degrees.
 
 
    Antenna Selector Switch
    -----------------------
      Under normal operating conditions, two way communications can
      be maintained between Lunar Prospector and a ground station
      having an 18-meter antenna using just the omnidirectional
      antenna, so long as the earth is within view of the
      spacecraft.
 
      Switching from the omni to the helix antenna (and vice versa,
      since the switch latches in the last commanded position) must
      be commanded from the ground.  Switching the transmitter to
      the medium gain helix increases the margin, but is not
      necessary to support the Lunar Prospector mission.  The two
      commands, Transmitter to MGA and Transmitter to Omni, are
      used to connect the transmitter to the helix (medium gain
      antenna) and the Omni (low gain antenna) respectively.  The
      antenna switch is a break-before-make switch specified to be
      capable of handling at least 5W RF power without any
      indication of corona or voltage breakdown.  The switch can
      sustain at least 50,000 switching cycles for a period in
      excess of two years on-orbit operation.
 
 
    Communications Telemetry
    ------------------------
      Telemetry is available from the S-band transponder and the
      antenna selector switch to enable operators to monitor the
      state of these devices.
 
      Received signal strength, receiver voltage, loop stress,
      transmitter voltage, transmitter output power, and
      transmitter temperature are analog signals; carrier lock
      status, transmitter on/off, coherent on/off, subcarrier
      oscillator on/off, convolutional encoding on/off and ranging
      on/off are discrete signals provided by the transponder.
 
      The antenna selector switch also provides a discrete
      indication of switch position.  The transmitter output power
      is monitored with a circuit that couples a sample of the RF
      output and conditions it to produce a 0 to 5 Vdc output.
 
 
  Science Objectives
  ==================
    The radio science experiment that was conducted with Lunar
    Prospector was a radio tracking experiment in which the
    magnitude and direction of the planet&apos;s gravity field were
    derived from the Doppler (and, sometimes, ranging)
    measurements.
 
 
    Gravity Measurements
    --------------------
      Measurement of the gravity field provides significant
      constraints on inferences about the interior structure of the
      moon.  Precise, detailed study of the spacecraft motion in
      lunar orbit can yield the mass distribution of the planet.
      Lunar topographic data (e.g.  Clementine data) forms a
      critical adjunct to these measurements since only after the
      gravitational effects are adjusted for topography can the
      gravity anomalies be interpreted geophysically.
 
      Studies of the gravity field emphasize both the global field
      and local characteristics of the field.  The first task is to
      determine the global field.  Doppler and range tracking
      measurements yield accurate spacecraft trajectory solutions.
      Simultaneously with reconstruction of the spacecraft orbit,
      observation equations for field coefficients and a small
      number of ancillary parameters can be solved.  This type of
      gravity field solution is essential for characterizing
      tectonic phenomena and can also be used to study localized
      features.
 
      &apos;Short-arc&apos; line-of-sight (LOS) Doppler tracking measurements
      obtained when the Earth-to-spacecraft line-of-sight is within
      a few degrees of the orbit plane provide the highest
      resolution of local features.  The results from this type of
      observation typically are presented as contoured acceleration
      profiles of specific features (e.g., craters, volcanoes,
      etc.) or line-of-sight acceleration maps of specific regions.
      The high spatial resolution of these products makes them
      especially useful to geophysicists for study of features in
      the size range of 30 to 1,000 km.  Because of the relative
      simplicity of the data analysis, results can be available
      within a few weeks after the data are collected.  However,
      more accurate LOS results can be obtained by referencing the
      LOS accelerations with respect to a gravity model.  This
      removes biases in the LOS accelerations that would normally
      be there as a result of spacecraft orbit error.  With this
      approach, delivery of the LOS data follows development and
      delivery of the gravity model.
 
 
  Operational Considerations - Spacecraft
  =======================================
 
    Receiver Performance
    --------------------
      The receiver section of the Lunar Prospector transponder is a
      dual-conversion, superhetrodyne design that down-converts the
      RF uplink carrier to a 2nd IF frequency (18.3 MHz) for
      baseband processing by the acquisition circuitry of the
      detector assembly.  The receiver is followed by a detector
      assembly that locks a local VCXO to the signal and outputs
      detected ranging, telecommand, and telemetry outputs.
 
      The transponder receiver can acquire an uplink carrier with
      center frequency 2093.0542 MHz +/- 150 KHz, within 1 minute
      after turn-on.  Recent tests showed the transponder acquired
      and maintained lock approximately +/- 280 kHz about the
      center frequency, which is well beyond the end of life (EOL)
      requirements.  The unit is designed to perform as specified
      for any signal between -125 dBm and -40 dBm, a dynamic range
      of 85 dBm.  Following removal of an RF input of + 3 dBm, the
      receiver will perform as specified within 10 seconds.
 
      At -20 degrees Celsius , the best lock frequency averaged
      2093.0655 MHz +/- 3.232 kHz, as contrasted to 2093.0216 +/-
      3.718 kHz at + 65 degrees Celsius.  Unfortunately
      insufficient data is available to reliably fit a curve
      between the extremes.  The two available data points suggest
      there is little change between -20 and +25 degrees Celsius.
      Frequency at turn-on is expected to be close to the 2093.0655
      MHz value.
 
      The receiver is capable of acquiring and tracking an RF
      signal over a +/- 90 KHz search range in less than or equal
      to 17.5 seconds when the unmodulated signal level is greater
      than or equal to -125 dBm.  During recent tests, the
      transponder acquisition threshold was -131 dBm, exceeding the
      EOL requirement.  The uplink command threshold, measured at
      -131 dBm also exceeds EOL requirements.  The transponder can
      track modulated or unmodulated carriers with a maximum
      doppler rate of 600 Hz/sec.
 
      Transponder range delay, measured at approximately 1350 nsec,
      more than meets the requirement to not exceed 1500 nsec.
 
 
    Transmitter Performance
    -----------------------
      The transmitter is designed to provide a nominal RF output of
      5 watts by end of life.  Telemetry data is converted from
      NRZ-L to NRZ-M form and then, if so commanded, rate 1/2
      convolutionally encoded prior to being BPSK modulated onto
      the 1.024 MHz subcarrier for downlinking, with or without
      turnaround ranging signals.  The resulting signal is linearly
      phase modulated onto the downlink RF carrier.  Turning off
      the subcarrier will result in loss of downlink data.
 
      In noncoherent mode, the transmit frequency of 2273 MHz is
      determined by an internal crystal oscillator.  The oscillator
      stability is +/- 25 ppm at 1 year and +/- 30 ppm at 3 years
      following acceptance test for the transponder.  In coherent
      mode, the transmitter frequency is derived from the received
      carrier VCXO signal by the ratio 240/221.
 
 
    Restrictions and Constraints
    ----------------------------
      The main constraint of the communication system is keeping
      the orientation of the communication cone toward earth.
 
 
  Calibration Description - Spacecraft
  ====================================
    No information available.
 
 
  Principal Investigators
  =======================
    The Principal Investigator for the gravity investigation was
    Alexander S. Konopliv.
 
 
  Instrument Section / Operating Mode Descriptions - Spacecraft
  =============================================================
    The transponder can be operated in either a noncoherent or
    coherent mode to support range rate determination.  In the
    former case, the downlink carrier is derived from an onboard
    oscillator that is tuned to the assigned downlink frequency; in
    the latter case, the downlink carrier frequency is locked to
    the uplink frequency at ratio of 240/221.  Coherent operation
    can be commanded ON or OFF.
 
    Lunar Prospector transmitter output power is greater than or
    equal to 5 Watts over the life of the mission.  Using the
    omnidirectional antenna, 5W is sufficient to close the downlink
    with more than 3 dB margin for data transmitted at a 3600 bps
    rate.  When enabled, rate 1/2 convolutional encoding increases
    the physical symbol rate to 7200 sps on the downlink.
 
 
  Instrument Overview - DSN
  =========================
    Three Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) (near
    Barstow, CA; Canberra, Australia; and Madrid, Spain) comprise
    the DSN tracking network.  Each complex is equipped with
    several antennas [including at least one each 70-m, 34-m High
    Efficiency (HEF), and 34-m standard (STD)], associated
    electronics, and operational systems.  Primary activity at each
    complex is radiation of commands to and reception of telemetry
    data from active spacecraft.  Transmission and reception is
    possible in several radio-frequency bands, the most common
    being S-band (nominally a frequency of 2100-2300 MHz or a
    wavelength of 14.2-13.0 cm) and X-band (7100-8500 MHz or 4.2-
    3.5 cm).  Transmitter output powers of up to 400 kw are
    available.
 
    Ground stations have the ability to transmit coded and uncoded
    waveforms which can be echoed by distant spacecraft.  Analysis
    of the received coding allows navigators to determine the
    distance to the spacecraft; analysis of Doppler shift on the
    carrier signal allows estimation of the line-of-sight
    spacecraft velocity.  Range and Doppler measurements are used
    to calculate the spacecraft trajectory and to infer gravity
    fields of objects near the spacecraft.
 
    Ground stations can record spacecraft signals that have
    propagated through or been scattered from target media.
    Measurements of signal parameters after wave interactions with
    surfaces, atmospheres, rings, and plasmas are used to infer
    physical and electrical properties of the target.
 
    Principal investigators vary from experiment to experiment.
    See the corresponding section of the spacecraft instrument
    description or the data set description for specifics.

  Subsystems - DSN
  ================
    The Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) are an integral
    part of the Radio Science instrument, along with other
    receiving stations and the spacecraft Radio Frequency
    Subsystem.  Their system performance directly determines the
    degree of success of Radio Science investigations, and their
    system calibration determines the degree of accuracy in the
    results of the experiments.  The following paragraphs describe
    the functions performed by the individual subsystems of a DSCC.
    This material has been adapted from [ASMAR&amp;HERRERA1993]; for
    additional information, consult [DSN810-5].
 
    Each DSCC includes a set of antennas, a Signal Processing
    Center (SPC), and communication links to the Jet Propulsion
    Laboratory (JPL).  The general configuration is illustrated
    below; antennas (Deep Space Stations, or DSS -- a term carried
    over from earlier times when antennas were individually
    instrumented) are listed in the table.

    DSCC Monitor and Control Subsystem
    ----------------------------------
      The DSCC Monitor and Control Subsystem (DMC) is part of the
      Monitor and Control System (MON) which also includes the
      ground communications Central Communications Terminal and the
      Network Operations Control Center (NOCC) Monitor and Control
      Subsystem.  The DMC is the center of activity at a DSCC.  The
      DMC receives and archives most of the information from the
      NOCC needed by the various DSCC subsystems during their
      operation.  Control of most of the DSCC subsystems, as well
      as the handling and displaying of any responses to control
      directives and configuration and status information received
      from each of the subsystems, is done through the DMC.  The
      effect of this is to centralize the control, display, and
      archiving functions necessary to operate a DSCC.
      Communication among the various subsystems is done using a
      Local Area Network (LAN) hooked up to each subsystem via a
      network interface unit (NIU).
 
      DMC operations are divided into two separate areas: the
      Complex Monitor and Control (CMC) and the Link Monitor and
      Control (LMC).  The primary purpose of the CMC processor for
      Radio Science support is to receive and store all predict
      sets transmitted from NOCC such as Radio Science, antenna
      pointing, tracking, receiver, and uplink predict sets and
      then, at a later time, to distribute them to the appropriate
      subsystems via the LAN.  Those predict sets can be stored in
      the CMC for a maximum of three days under normal conditions.
      The CMC also receives, processes, and displays event/alarm
      messages; maintains an operator log; and produces tape labels
      for the DSP.  Assignment and configuration of the LMCs is
      done through the CMC; to a limited degree the CMC can perform
      some of the functions performed by the LMC.  There are two
      CMCs (one on-line and one backup) and three LMCs at each DSCC
      The backup CMC can function as an additional LMC if
      necessary.
 
      The LMC processor provides the operator interface for monitor
      and control of a link -- a group of equipment required to
      support a spacecraft pass.  For Radio Science, a link might
      include the DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP) (which,
      in turn, can control the SSI), or the Tracking Subsystem.
      The LMC also maintains an operator log which includes
      operator directives and subsystem responses.  One important
      Radio Science specific function that the LMC performs is
      receipt and transmission of the system temperature and signal
      level data from the PPM for display at the LMC console and
      for inclusion in Monitor blocks.  These blocks are recorded
      on magnetic tape as well as appearing in the Mission Control
      and Computing Center (MCCC) displays.  The LMC is required to
      operate without interruption for the duration of the Radio
      Science data acquisition period.
 
      The Area Routing Assembly (ARA), which is part of the Digital
      Communications Subsystem, controls all data communication
      between the stations and JPL.  The ARA receives all required
      data and status messages from the LMC/CMC and can record them
      to tape as well as transmit them to JPL via data lines.  The
      ARA also receives predicts and other data from JPL and passes
      them on to the CMC.
 
 
    DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem
    ---------------------------------
      Multi-mission Radio Science activities require support from
      the 70-m, 34-m HEF, and 34-m STD antenna subnets.  The
      antennas at each DSCC function as large-aperture collectors
      which, by double reflection, cause the incoming radio
      frequency (RF) energy to enter the feed horns.  The large
      collecting surface of the antenna focuses the incoming energy
      onto a subreflector, which is adjustable in both axial and
      angular position.  These adjustments are made to correct for
      gravitational deformation of the antenna as it moves between
      zenith and the horizon; the deformation can be as large as 5
      cm.  The subreflector adjustments optimize the channeling of
      energy from the primary reflector to the subreflector and
      then to the feed horns.  The 70-m and 34-m HEF antennas have
      &apos;shaped&apos; primary and secondary reflectors, with forms that
      are modified paraboloids.  This customization allows more
      uniform illumination of one reflector by another.  The 34-m
      STD primary reflectors are classical paraboloids, while the
      subreflectors are standard hyperboloids.
 
      On the 70-m and 34-m STD antennas, the subreflector directs
      received energy from the antenna onto a dichroic plate, a
      device which reflects S-band energy to the S-band feed horn
      and passes X-band energy through to the X-band feed horn.  In
      the 34-m HEF, there is one &apos;common aperture feed,&apos; which
      accepts both frequencies without requiring a dichroic plate.
      RF energy to be transmitted into space by the horns is
      focused by the reflectors into narrow cylindrical beams,
      pointed with high precision (either to the dichroic plate or
      directly to the subreflector) by a series of drive motors and
      gear trains that can rotate the movable components and their
      support structures.
 
      The different antennas can be pointed by several means.  Two
      pointing modes commonly used during tracking passes are
      CONSCAN and &apos;blind pointing.&apos; With CONSCAN enabled and a
      closed loop receiver locked to a spacecraft signal, the
      system tracks the radio source by conically scanning around
      its position in the sky.  Pointing angle adjustments are
      computed from signal strength information (feedback) supplied
      by the receiver.  In this mode the Antenna Pointing Assembly
      (APA) generates a circular scan pattern which is sent to the
      Antenna Control System (ACS).  The ACS adds the scan pattern
      to the corrected pointing angle predicts.  Software in the
      receiver-exciter controller computes the received signal
      level and sends it to the APA.  The correlation of scan
      position with the received signal level variations allows the
      APA to compute offset changes which are sent to the ACS.
      Thus, within the capability of the closed-loop control
      system, the scan center is pointed precisely at the apparent
      direction of the spacecraft signal source.  An additional
      function of the APA is to provide antenna position angles and
      residuals, antenna control mode/status information, and
      predict-correction parameters to the Area Routing Assembly
      (ARA) via the LAN, which then sends this information to JPL
      via the Ground Communications Facility (GCF) for antenna
      status monitoring.
 
      During periods when excessive signal level dynamics or low
      received signal levels are expected (e.g., during an
      occultation experiment), CONSCAN should not be used.  Under
      these conditions, blind pointing (CONSCAN OFF) is used, and
      pointing angle adjustments are based on a predetermined
      Systematic Error Correction (SEC) model.
 
      Independent of CONSCAN state, subreflector motion in at least
      the z-axis may introduce phase variations into the received
      Radio Science data.  For that reason, during certain
      experiments, the subreflector in the 70-m and 34-m HEFs may
      be frozen in the z-axis at a position (often based on
      elevation angle) selected to minimize phase change and signal
      degradation.  This can be done via Operator Control Inputs
      (OCIs) from the LMC to the Subreflector Controller (SRC)
      which resides in the alidade room of the antennas.  The SRC
      passes the commands to motors that drive the subreflector to
      the desired position.  Unlike the 70-m and 34-m HEFs which
      have azimuth-elevation (AZ-EL) drives, the 34-m STD antennas
      use (hour angle-declination) HA-DEC drives.  The same
      positioning of the subreflector on the 34-m STD does not
      create the same effect as on the 70-m and 34-m HEFs.
 
      Pointing angles for all three antenna types are computed by
      the NOCC Support System (NSS) from an ephemeris provided by
      the flight project.  These predicts are received and archived
      by the CMC.  Before each track, they are transferred to the
      APA, which transforms the direction cosines of the predicts
      into AZ-EL coordinates for the 70-m and 34-m HEFs or into
      HA-DEC coordinates for the 34-m STD antennas.  The LMC
      operator then downloads the antenna AZ-EL or HA-DEC predict
      points to the antenna-mounted ACS computer along with a
      selected SEC model.  The pointing predicts consist of
      time-tagged AZ-EL or HA-DEC points at selected time intervals
      along with polynomial coefficients for interpolation between
      points.
 
      The ACS automatically interpolates the predict points,
      corrects the pointing predicts for refraction and
      subreflector position, and adds the proper systematic error
      correction and any manually entered antenna offsets.  The ACS
      then sends angular position commands for each axis at the
      rate of one per second.  In the 70-m and 34-m HEF, rate
      commands are generated from the position commands at the
      servo controller and are subsequently used to steer the
      antenna.  In the 34-m STD antennas motors, rather than
      servos, are used to steer the antenna; there is no feedback
      once the 34-m STD has been told where to point.
 
      When not using binary predicts (the routine mode for
      spacecraft tracking), the antennas can be pointed using
      &apos;planetary mode&apos; -- a simpler mode which uses right ascension
      (RA) and declination (DEC) values.  These change very slowly
      with respect to the celestial frame.  Values are provided to
      the station in text form for manual entry.  The ACS
      quadratically interpolates among three RA and DEC points
      which are on one-day centers.
 
      A third pointing mode -- sidereal -- is available for
      tracking radio sources fixed with respect to the celestial
      frame.
 
      Regardless of the pointing mode being used, a 70-m antenna
      has a special high-accuracy pointing capability called
      &apos;precision&apos; mode.  A pointing control loop derives the main
      AZ-EL pointing servo drive error signals from a two- axis
      autocollimator mounted on the Intermediate Reference
      Structure.  The autocollimator projects a light beam to a
      precision mirror mounted on the Master Equatorial drive
      system, a much smaller structure, independent of the main
      antenna, which is exactly positioned in HA and DEC with shaft
      encoders.  The autocollimator detects elevation/cross-
      elevation errors between the two reference surfaces by
      measuring the angular displacement of the reflected light
      beam.  This error is compensated for in the antenna servo by
      moving the antenna in the appropriate AZ-EL direction.
      Pointing accuracies of 0.004 degrees (15 arc seconds) are
      possible in &apos;precision&apos; mode.  The &apos;precision&apos; mode is not
      available on 34-m antennas -- nor is it needed, since their
      beamwidths are twice as large as on the 70-m antennas.
 
 
    DSCC Antenna Microwave Subsystem
    --------------------------------
      70-m Antennas: Each 70-m antenna has three feed cones
      installed in a structure at the center of the main reflector.
      The feeds are positioned 120 degrees apart on a circle.
      Selection of the feed is made by rotation of the
      subreflector.  A dichroic mirror assembly, half on the S-band
      cone and half on the X-band cone, permits simultaneous use of
      the S- and X-band frequencies.  The third cone is devoted to
      R&amp;D and more specialized work.
 
      The Antenna Microwave Subsystem (AMS) accepts the received S-
      and X-band signals at the feed horn and transmits them
      through polarizer plates to an orthomode transducer.  The
      polarizer plates are adjusted so that the signals are
      directed to a pair of redundant amplifiers for each
      frequency, thus allowing simultaneous reception of signals in
      two orthogonal polarizations.  For S-band these are two Block
      IVA S-band Traveling Wave Masers (TWMs); for X-band the
      amplifiers are Block IIA TWMs.
 
      34-m STD Antennas: These antennas have two feed horns, one
      for S-band signals and one for X-band.  The horns are mounted
      on a cone which is fixed in relation to the subreflector.  A
      dichroic plate mounted above the horns directs energy from
      the subreflector into the proper horn.
 
      The AMS directs the received S- and X-band signals through
      polarizer plates and on to amplification.  There are two
      Block III S-band TWMs and two Block I X-band TWMs.
 
      34-m HEF Antennas: Unlike the other antennas, the 34-m HEF
      uses a single feed for both S- and X-band.  Simultaneous S-
      and X-band receive as well as X-band transmit is possible
      thanks to the presence of an S/X &apos;combiner&apos; which acts as a
      diplexer.  For S-band, RCP or LCP is user selected through a
      switch so neither a polarizer nor an orthomode transducer is
      needed.  X-band amplification options include two Block II
      TWMs or an HEMT Low Noise Amplifier (LNA).  S-band
      amplification is provided by an FET LNA.
 
 
    DSCC Receiver-Exciter Subsystem
    -------------------------------
      The Receiver-Exciter Subsystem is composed of three groups of
      equipment: the closed-loop receiver group, the open-loop
      receiver group, and the RF monitor group.  This subsystem is
      controlled by the Receiver-Exciter Controller (REC) which
      communicates directly with the DMC for predicts and OCI
      reception and status reporting.
 
      The exciter generates the S-band signal (or X-band for the
      34-m HEF only) which is provided to the Transmitter Subsystem
      for the spacecraft uplink signal.  It is tunable under
      command of the Digitally Controlled Oscillator (DCO) which
      receives predicts from the Metric Data Assembly (MDA).
 
      The diplexer in the signal path between the transmitter and
      the feed horn for all three antennas (used for simultaneous
      transmission and reception) may be configured such that it is
      out of the received signal path (in listen-only or bypass
      mode) in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the
      receiver system.
 
      Closed Loop Receivers: The Block IV receiver-exciter at the
      70-m stations allows for two receiver channels, each capable
      of L-Band (e.g., 1668 MHz frequency or 18 cm wavelength),
      S-band, or X-band reception, and an S-band exciter for
      generation of uplink signals through the low-power or
      high-power transmitter.  The Block III receiver-exciter at
      the 34-m STD stations allows for two receiver channels, each
      capable of S-band or X-band reception and an exciter used to
      generate an uplink signal through the low-power transmitter.
      The receiver-exciter at the 34-m HEF stations allows for one
      channel only.
 
      The closed-loop receivers provide the capability for rapid
      acquisition of a spacecraft signal and telemetry lockup.  In
      order to accomplish acquisition within a short time, the
      receivers are predict driven to search for, acquire, and
      track the downlink automatically.  Rapid acquisition
      precludes manual tuning though that remains as a backup
      capability.  The subsystem utilizes FFT analyzers for rapid
      acquisition.  The predicts are NSS generated, transmitted to
      the CMC which sends them to the Receiver-Exciter Subsystem
      where two sets can be stored.  The receiver starts
      acquisition at uplink time plus one round-trip-light-time or
      at operator specified times.  The receivers may also be
      operated from the LMC without a local operator attending
      them.  The receivers send performance and status data,
      displays, and event messages to the LMC.
 
      Either the exciter synthesizer signal or the simulation (SIM)
      synthesizer signal is used as the reference for the Doppler
      extractor in the closed-loop receiver systems, depending on
      the spacecraft being tracked (and Project guidelines).  The
      SIM synthesizer is not ramped; instead it uses one constant
      frequency, the Track Synthesizer Frequency (TSF), which is an
      average frequency for the entire pass.
 
      The closed-loop receiver AGC loop can be configured to one of
      three settings: narrow, medium, or wide.  It will be
      configured such that the expected amplitude changes are
      accommodated with minimum distortion.  The loop bandwidth
      (2BLo) will be configured such that the expected phase
      changes can be accommodated while maintaining the best
      possible loop SNR.
 
      Open-Loop Receivers: There are two types of Radio Science
      Open-Loop Receivers (OLR) in use.  At 70-m and 34-m HEF
      stations the OLR is a a dedicated four channel, narrow-band
      receiver which provides amplified and downconverted video
      band signals to the DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP);
      it sometimes goes by the designation &apos;RIV&apos;.  At 34-m STD
      stations (DSS 42 and DSS 61) the OLR is an older system, the
      Multi-Mission Receiver (MMR), which provides two channels of
      narrow-band receiver output.  Both OLR systems are described
      in detail below under &apos;Electronics - DSN&apos;; here the overview
      continues only for the RIV system.
 
      The 70-m and 34-m HEF OLR utilizes a fixed first Local
      Oscillator (LO) frequency and a tunable second LO frequency
      to minimize phase noise and improve frequency stability.  The
      OLR consists of an RF-to-IF downconverter located in the
      antenna, an IF selection switch (IVC), and a Radio Science
      IF-VF downconverter (RIV) located in the SPC.  The RF-IF
      downconverters in the 70-m antennas are equipped for four IF
      channels: S-RCP, S-LCP, X-RCP, and X-LCP.  The 34-m HEF
      stations are equipped with a two-channel RF-IF: S-band and
      X-band.  The IVC switches the IF input between the 70-m and
      34-m HEF antennas.
 
      The RIV contains the tunable second LO, a set of video
      bandpass filters, IF attenuators, and a controller (RIC).
      The LO tuning is done via DSP control of the POCA/PLO
      combination based on a predict set.  The POCA is a
      Programmable Oscillator Control Assembly and the PLO is a
      Programmable Local Oscillator (commonly called the DANA
      synthesizer).  The bandpass filters are selectable via the
      DSP.  The RIC provides an interface between the DSP and the
      RIV.  It is controlled from the LMC via the DSP.  The RIC
      selects the filter and attenuator settings and provides
      monitor data to the DSP.  The RIC could also be manually
      controlled from the front panel in case the electronic
      interface to the DSP is lost.
 
      RF Monitor -- SSI and PPM: The RF monitor group of the
      Receiver-Exciter Subsystem provides spectral measurements
      using the Spectral Signal Indicator (SSI) and measurements of
      the received channel system temperature and spacecraft signal
      level using the Precision Power Monitor (PPM).
 
      The SSI provides a local display of the received signal
      spectrum at a dedicated terminal at the DSCC and routes these
      same data to the DSP which routes them to NOCC for remote
      display at JPL for real-time monitoring and RIV/DSP
      configuration verification.  These displays are used to
      validate Radio Science Subsystem data at the DSS, NOCC, and
      Mission Support Areas.  The SSI configuration is controlled
      by the DSP and a duplicate of the SSI spectrum appears on the
      LMC via the DSP.  During real-time operations the SSI data
      also serve as a quick-look science data type for Radio
      Science experiments.
 
      The PPM measures system noise temperatures (SNT) using a
      Noise Adding Radiometer (NAR) and downlink signal levels
      using the Signal Level Estimator (SLE).  The PPM accepts its
      input from the closed-loop receiver.  The SNT is measured by
      injecting known amounts of noise power into the signal path
      and comparing the total power with the noise injection &apos;on&apos;
      against the total power with the noise injection &apos;off.&apos; That
      operation is based on the fact that receiver noise power is
      directly proportional to temperature; thus measuring the
      relative increase in noise power due to the presence of a
      calibrated thermal noise source allows direct calculation of
      SNT.  Signal level is measured by calculating an FFT to
      estimate the SNR between the signal level and the receiver
      noise floor where the power is known from the SNT
      measurements.
 
      There is one PPM controller at the SPC which is used to
      control all SNT measurements.  The SNT integration time can
      be selected to represent the time required for a measurement
      of 30K to have a one-sigma uncertainty of 0.3K or 1%.
 
 
    DSCC Transmitter Subsystem
    --------------------------
      The Transmitter Subsystem accepts the S-band frequency
      exciter signal from the Block III or Block IV Receiver-
      Exciter Subsystem exciter and amplifies it to the required
      transmit output level.  The amplified signal is routed via
      the diplexer through the feed horn to the antenna and then
      focused and beamed to the spacecraft.
 
      The Transmitter Subsystem power capabilities range from 18 kw
      to 400 kw.  Power levels above 18 kw are available only at
      70-m stations.
 
 
    DSCC Tracking Subsystem
    -----------------------
      The Tracking Subsystem primary functions are to acquire and
      maintain communications with the spacecraft and to generate
      and format radiometric data containing Doppler and range.
 
      The DSCC Tracking Subsystem (DTK) receives the carrier
      signals and ranging spectra from the Receiver-Exciter
      Subsystem.  The Doppler cycle counts are counted, formatted,
      and transmitted to JPL in real time.  Ranging data are also
      transmitted to JPL in real time.  Also contained in these
      blocks is the AGC information from the Receiver-Exciter
      Subsystem.  The Radio Metric Data Conditioning Team (RMDCT)
      at JPL produces an Archival Tracking Data File (ATDF) which
      contains Doppler and ranging data.
 
      In addition, the Tracking Subsystem receives from the CMC
      frequency predicts (used to compute frequency residuals and
      noise estimates), receiver tuning predicts (used to tune the
      closed-loop receivers), and uplink tuning predicts (used to
      tune the exciter).  From the LMC, it receives configuration
      and control directives as well as configuration and status
      information on the transmitter, microwave, and frequency and
      timing subsystems.
 
      The Metric Data Assembly (MDA) controls all of the DTK
      functions supporting the uplink and downlink activities.  The
      MDA receives uplink predicts and controls the uplink tuning
      by commanding the DCO.  The MDA also controls the Sequential
      Ranging Assembly (SRA).  It formats the Doppler and range
      measurements and provides them to the GCF for transmission to
      NOCC.
 
      The Sequential Ranging Assembly (SRA) measures the round trip
      light time (RTLT) of a radio signal traveling from a ground
      tracking station to a spacecraft and back.  From the RTLT,
      phase, and Doppler data, the spacecraft range can be
      determined.  A coded signal is modulated on an uplink carrier
      and transmitted to the spacecraft where it is detected and
      transponded back to the ground station.  As a result, the
      signal received at the tracking station is delayed by its
      round trip through space and shifted in frequency by the
      Doppler effect due to the relative motion between the
      spacecraft and the tracking station on Earth.
 
 
    DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP)
    ----------------------------------------
      The DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP) located at the
      SPC digitizes and records the narrowband output data from the
      RIV.  It consists of a Narrow Band Occultation Converter
      (NBOC) containing four Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs), a
      ModComp CLASSIC computer processor called the Spectrum
      Processing Assembly (SPA), and several magnetic tape drives.
      Magnetic tapes containing DSP output are known as Original
      Data Records (ODRs).  Electronic near real-time data
      transmission (known as an Original Data Stream, or ODS) may
      be possible in certain circumstances.
 
      The DSP is operated through the LMC.  Using the
      SPA-Radioscience (SPA-R) software, the DSP allows for
      real-time frequency and time offsets (while in RUN mode) and,
      if necessary, snap tuning between the two frequency ranges
      transmitted by the spacecraft: coherent and non-coherent.
      The DSP receives Radio Science frequency predicts from the
      CMC, allows for multiple predict set archiving (up to 60
      sets) at the SPA, and allows for manual predict generation
      and editing.  It accepts configuration and control data from
      the LMC, provides display data to the LMC, and transmits the
      signal spectra from the SSI as well as status information to
      NOCC and the Project Mission Support Area (MSA) via the GCF
      data lines.  The DSP records the digitized narrowband samples
      and the supporting header information (i.e., time tags, POCA
      frequencies, etc.) on 9-track magnetic tapes in 6250 or 1600
      bpi GCR format.
 
      Through the DSP-RIC interface the DSP controls the RIV filter
      selection and attenuation levels.  It also receives RIV
      performance monitoring via the RIC.  In case of failure of
      the DSP-RIC interface, the RIV can be controlled manually
      from the front panel.
 
      All the RIV and DSP control parameters and configuration
      directives are stored in the SPA in a macro-like file called
      an &apos;experiment directive&apos; table.  A number of default
      directives exist in the DSP for the major Radio Science
      experiments.  Operators can create their own table entries.
 
      Items such as verification of the configuration of the prime
      open-loop recording subsystem, the selection of the required
      predict sets, and proper system performance prior to the
      recording periods will be checked in real-time at JPL via the
      NOCC displays using primarily the remote SSI display at NOCC
      and the NRV displays.  Because of this, transmission of the
      DSP/SSI monitor information is enabled prior to the start of
      recording.  The specific run time and tape recording times
      will be identified in the Sequence of Events (SOE) and/or DSN
      Keyword File.
 
      The DSP can be used to duplicate ODRs.  It also has the
      capability to play back a certain section of the recorded
      data after conclusion of the recording periods.
 
 
    DSCC Frequency and Timing Subsystem
    -----------------------------------
      The Frequency and Timing Subsystem (FTS) provides all
      frequency and timing references required by the other DSCC
      subsystems.  It contains four frequency standards of which
      one is prime and the other three are backups.  Selection of
      the prime standard is done via the CMC.  Of these four
      standards, two are hydrogen masers followed by clean-up loops
      (CUL) and two are cesium standards.  These four standards all
      feed the Coherent Reference Generator (CRG) which provides
      the frequency references used by the rest of the complex.  It
      also provides the frequency reference to the Master Clock
      Assembly (MCA) which in turn provides time to the Time
      Insertion and Distribution Assembly (TID) which provides UTC
      and SIM-time to the complex.
 
      JPL&apos;s ability to monitor the FTS at each DSCC is limited to
      the MDA calculated Doppler pseudo-residuals, the Doppler
      noise, the SSI, and to a system which uses the Global
      Positioning System (GPS).  GPS receivers at each DSCC receive
      a one-pulse-per-second pulse from the station&apos;s (hydrogen
      maser referenced) FTS and a pulse from a GPS satellite at
      scheduled times.  After compensating for the satellite signal
      delay, the timing offset is reported to JPL where a database
      is kept.  The clock offsets stored in the JPL database are
      given in microseconds; each entry is a mean reading of
      measurements from several GPS satellites and a time tag
      associated with the mean reading.  The clock offsets provided
      include those of SPC 10 relative to UTC (NIST), SPC 40
      relative to SPC 10, etc.
 
 
  Optics - DSN
  ============
    Performance of DSN ground stations depends primarily on size of
    the antenna and capabilities of electronics.  These are
    summarized in the following set of tables.  Note that 64-m
    antennas were upgraded to 70-m between 1986 and 1989.
    Beamwidth is half-power full angular width.  Polarization is
    circular; L denotes left circular polarization (LCP), and R
    denotes right circular polarization (RCP).

               planetary radar system.  For telecommunications, the
               transmitting frequency would be in the range 7145-7190
               MHz, the power would typically be 20 kW, and the gain
               would be about 72.6 dB (70-m antenna).  When ground
               transmitters are used in spacecraft radio science
               experiments, the details of transmitter and antenna
               performance rarely impact the results.

    DSCC Open-Loop Receiver (RIV)
    -----------------------------
      The open loop receiver block diagram shown below is for the
      RIV system at 70-m and 34-m High-Efficiency (HEF) antenna
      sites.  Input signals at both S- and X-band are mixed to
      approximately 300 MHz by fixed-frequency local oscillators
      near the antenna feed.  Based on a tuning prediction file,
      the POCA controls the DANA synthesizer, the output of which
      (after multiplication) mixes the 300 MHz IF to 50 MHz for
      amplification.  These signals in turn are down converted and
      passed through additional filters until they yield Output
      with bandwidths up to 45 kHz.  The Output is digitally
      sampled and either written to magnetic tape or electronically
      transferred for further analysis.

        Reconstruction of the antenna frequency from the frequency of
        the signal in the recorded data can be achieved through use
        of one of the following formulas.  Filters are defined below.
 
           FSant=3*SYN+1.95*10^9+3*(790/11)*10^6+Frec        (Filter 4)

            where
                FSant,FXant  are the antenna frequencies of the incoming
                             signals at S and X bands, respectively,

                             synthesizer,commonly labeled the readback
                             POCA frequency on data tapes,
 
                Fsamp        is the effective sampling rate of the
                             digital samples, and
 
                Frec         is the apparent signal frequency in a
                             spectrum reconstructed from the digital
                             samples.
 
                   NB: For many of the filter choices (see below) the
                       Output is that of a bandpass filter.  The
                       sampling rates in the table below are sufficient
                       for the bandwidth but not the absolute maximum
                       frequency, and aliasing results.  The
                       reconstruction expressions above are appropriate
                       ONLY when the sample rate shown in the tables
                       below is used.
 
 
    DSCC Open-Loop Receiver (MMR at DSS 5 and 61)
    ---------------------------------------------
      The open loop receiver block diagram shown below is for MMR
      systems at the 34-m Standard (STD) DSS 61 antenna site and at
      the DSS 5 JPL DSN facility.  Based on a tuning prediction
      file, the POCA controls the DANA synthesizer, the output of
      which (after multiplication) mixes input signals at both S-
      and X-band to fixed intermediate frequencies for
      amplification.  These signals in turn are down converted and
      passed through additional filters until they yield Output
      with bandwidths up to 45 kHz.  The Output is digitally
      sampled and either written to magnetic tape or electronically
      transferred for further analysis.

  Detectors - DSN
  ===============
 
    DSCC Open-Loop Receivers
    ------------------------
      Open-loop receiver output is detected in software by the
      radio science investigator.
 
 
    DSCC Closed-Loop Receivers
    --------------------------
      Nominal carrier tracking loop threshold noise bandwidth at
      both S- and X-band is 10 Hz.  Coherent (two-way) closed-loop
      system stability is shown in the table below:
 
            integration time            Doppler uncertainty

                  1000                             4
 
 
  Calibration - DSN
  =================
    Calibrations of hardware systems are carried out periodically
    by DSN personnel; these ensure that systems operate at required
    performance levels -- for example, that antenna patterns,
    receiver gain, propagation delays, and Doppler uncertainties
    meet specifications.  No information on specific calibration
    activities is available.  Nominal performance specifications
    are shown in the tables above.  Additional information may be
    available in [DSN810-5].
 
    Prior to each tracking pass, station operators perform a series
    of calibrations to ensure that systems meet specifications for
    that operational period.  Included in these calibrations is
    measurement of receiver system temperature in the configuration
    to be employed during the pass.  Results of these calibrations
    are recorded in (hard copy) Controller&apos;s Logs for each pass.
 
    The nominal procedure for initializing open-loop receiver
    attenuator settings is described below.  In cases where widely
    varying signal levels are expected, the procedure may be
    modified in advance or real-time adjustments may be made to
    attenuator settings.
 
 
    Open-Loop Receiver Attenuation Calibration
    ------------------------------------------
      The open-loop receiver attenuator calibrations are performed
      to establish the output of the open-loop receivers at a level
      that will not saturate the analog-to-digital converters.  To
      achieve this, the calibration is done using a test signal
      generated by the exciter/translator that is set to the peak
      predicted signal level for the upcoming pass.  Then the
      output level of the receiver&apos;s video band spectrum envelope
      is adjusted to the level determined by equation (3) below (to
      five-sigma).  Note that the SNR in the equation (2) is in dB
      while the SNR in equation (3) is linear.
 
           Pn = -198.6 + 10*log(SNT) + 10*log(1.2*Fbw)              (1)
 
           SNR = Ps - Pn                               (SNR in dB)  (2)
 
           Vrms = sqrt(SNR + 1)/[1 + 0.283*sqrt(SNR)]  (SNR linear) (3)
 
           where    Fbw = receiver filter bandwidth (Hz)
                    Pn  = receiver noise power (dBm)
                    Ps  = signal power (dBm)
                    SNT = system noise temperature (K)
                    SNR = predicted signal-to-noise ratio
 
 
  Operational Considerations - DSN
  ================================
    The DSN is a complex and dynamic &apos;instrument.&apos; Its performance
    for Radio Science depends on a number of factors from equipment
    configuration to meteorological conditions.  No specific
    information on &apos;operational considerations&apos; can be given here.
 
 
  Operational Modes - DSN
  =======================
 
    DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem
    ---------------------------------
      Pointing of DSCC antennas may be carried out in several ways.
      For details see the subsection &apos;DSCC Antenna Mechanical
      Subsystem&apos; in the &apos;Subsystem&apos; section.  Binary pointing is
      the preferred mode for tracking spacecraft; pointing predicts
      are provided, and the antenna simply follows those.  With
      CONSCAN, the antenna scans conically about the optimum
      pointing direction, using closed-loop receiver signal
      strength estimates as feedback.  In planetary mode, the
      system interpolates from three (slowly changing) RA-DEC
      target coordinates; this is &apos;blind&apos; pointing since there is
      no feedback from a detected signal.  In sidereal mode, the
      antenna tracks a fixed point on the celestial sphere.  In
      &apos;precision&apos; mode, the antenna pointing is adjusted using an
      optical feedback system.  It is possible on most antennas to
      freeze z-axis motion of the subreflector to minimize phase
      changes in the received signal.
 
 
    DSCC Receiver-Exciter Subsystem
    -------------------------------
      The diplexer in the signal path between the transmitter and
      the feed horns on all three antennas may be configured so
      that it is out of the received signal path in order to
      improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the receiver system.
      This is known as the &apos;listen-only&apos; or &apos;bypass&apos; mode.
 
 
    Closed-Loop vs. Open-Loop Reception
    -----------------------------------
      Radio Science data can be collected in two modes: closed-
      loop, in which a phase-locked loop receiver tracks the
      spacecraft signal, or open-loop, in which a receiver samples
      and records a band within which the desired signal presumably
      resides.  Closed-loop data are collected using Closed-Loop
      Receivers, and open-loop data are collected using Open-Loop
      Receivers in conjunction with the DSCC Spectrum Processing
      Subsystem (DSP).  See the Subsystems section for further
      information.
 
 
    Closed-Loop Receiver AGC Loop
    -----------------------------
      The closed-loop receiver AGC loop can be configured to one of
      three settings: narrow, medium, or wide.  Ordinarily it is
      configured so that expected signal amplitude changes are
      accommodated with minimum distortion.  The loop bandwidth is
      ordinarily configured so that expected phase changes can be
      accommodated while maintaining the best possible loop SNR.
 
 
    Coherent vs. Non-Coherent Operation
    -----------------------------------
      The frequency of the signal transmitted from the spacecraft
      can generally be controlled in two ways -- by locking to a
      signal received from a ground station or by locking to an
      on-board oscillator.  These are known as the coherent (or
      &apos;two-way&apos;) and non-coherent (&apos;one-way&apos;) modes, respectively.
      Mode selection is made at the spacecraft, based on commands
      received from the ground.  When operating in the coherent
      mode, the transponder carrier frequency is derived from the
      received uplink carrier frequency with a &apos;turn-around ratio&apos;
      typically of 240/221.  In the non-coherent mode, the downlink
      carrier frequency is derived from the spacecraft on-board
      crystal-controlled oscillator.  Either closed-loop or
      open-loop receivers (or both) can be used with either
      spacecraft frequency reference mode.  Closed-loop reception
      in two-way mode is usually preferred for routine tracking.
      Occasionally the spacecraft operates coherently while two
      ground stations receive the &apos;downlink&apos; signal; this is
      sometimes known as the &apos;three-way&apos; mode.
 
 
    DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP)
    ----------------------------------------
      The DSP can operate in four sampling modes with from 1 to 4
      input signals.  Input channels are assigned to ADC inputs
      during DSP configuration.  Modes and sampling rates are
      summarized in the tables below:

  Measurement Parameters - DSN
  ============================
 
    Open-Loop System
    ----------------
      Output from the Open-Loop Receivers (OLRs), as sampled and
      recorded by the DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP), is
      a stream of 8- or 12-bit quantized voltage samples.  The
      nominal input to the Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) is
      +/-10 volts, but the precise scaling between input voltages
      and output digitized samples is usually irrelevant for
      analysis; the digital data are generally referenced to a
      known noise or signal level within the data stream itself --
      for example, the thermal noise output of the radio receivers
      which has a known system noise temperature (SNT).  Raw
      samples comprise the data block in each DSP record; a header
      record (presently 83 16-bit words) contains ancillary
      information such as:
 
      time tag for the first sample in the data block RMS values of
      receiver signal levels and ADC outputs POCA frequency and
      drift rate
 
 
    Closed-Loop System
    ------------------
      Closed-loop data are recorded in Archival Tracking Data Files
      (ATDFs), as well as certain secondary products such as the
      Orbit Data File (ODF).  The ATDF Tracking Logical Record
      contains 117 entries including status information and
      measurements of ranging, Doppler, and signal strength.
