    Instrument Overview
    ===================
      The Mars Observer spacecraft telecommunications subsystem was
      to have served as part of a Radio Science instrument for
      investigations of Mars.  The remainder of the &apos;instrument&apos; was
      located at ground stations of the NASA Deep Space Network
      (DSN).  Much of the equipment at both ends was shared, being
      used for routine telecommunications as well as for Radio
      Science.  Radio data were themselves shared; Doppler and range
      measurements were used to calculate the spacecraft trajectory
      and to search for gravity waves.  Measurements of signal
      parameters after waves had propagated through the
      interplanetary medium were used to infer properties of the
      medium, characterize small perturbations in spacecraft
      attitude, and search for gravity waves.
 
      Data included in this archive data set are from routine
      tracking and special tests conducted while Mars Observer was in
      its Cruise Phase between Earth and Mars.  Cruise operations
      were used to improve operator proficiency in carrying out
      activities related to radio science observations and to measure
      the performance of various parts of the radio science and
      ground data systems.
 
 
    Instrument Overview - Spacecraft
    ================================
      Spacecraft Radio System: The spacecraft radio system was
      constructed around a redundant pair of Mars Observer
      Transponders (MOTs) which received at 7.2 GHz and transmitted
      at 8.4 GHz, both of which are called &apos;X-band&apos; frequencies.  The
      exact transmitted frequency was controlled by the signal
      received from a ground station or by an on-board oscillator.
      The transponders provided the usual uplink command and downlink
      data transmission capabilities.  The MOT also included a
      ranging &apos;channel&apos; which could be driven either by signals from
      the ground for measurement of absolute range or by tones
      generated on-board to enable measurement of differential range
      between two ground stations.
 
      An MOT generated a downlink signal in either a &apos;coherent&apos; or a
      &apos;non-coherent&apos; mode, also known as the &apos;two-way&apos; and &apos;one-way&apos;
      modes, respectively.  When operating in the coherent mode, the
      MOT behaved as a conventional transponder, its transmitted
      carrier frequency being derived from the received uplink
      carrier frequency with a &apos;turn-around ratio&apos; of 880/749.  In
      the non-coherent mode, the downlink carrier frequency was
      derived from one of the spacecraft&apos;s on-board oscillators.
 
      One of the on-board oscillators, the &apos;ultra-stable oscillator&apos;
      (USO), had been specially provided to serve as a precision
      frequency reference for radio occultation experiments.  Built
      by the Applied Physics Laboratory of John Hopkins University,
      the USO was positioned within the spacecraft so as to minimize
      its exposure to thermal variations and mechanical vibration.
      The USO consisted of a quartz crystal resonator contained in a
      temperature-controlled titanium dewar.  Its output frequency
      was near 19.14 MHz.  The X-band carrier for non-coherent
      downlink transmission was produced by multiplying the USO
      output frequency by 440.  The Mars Observer USO was from a
      newer generation than those flown on the Voyager and Galileo
      spacecraft.  Its frequency stability, as characterized by the
      Allan deviation and after accounting for linear drift, was
      measured to be better than 2E-13 for integration times in the
      range one to several hundred seconds.  This represents more
      than an order of magnitude improvement in performance over the
      Voyager and Galileo devices.  After a 25 day warm-up period,
      the USO was expected to have a daily aging rate of 6E-11 and a
      long term frequency change after five years of significantly
      less than 1E-6.  Laboratory measurements also showed
      state-of-the-art phase noise and spectral purity as well as
      amplitude stability performance for a device of this type.
      During Cruise, the USO drifted 0.2 Hz/day at its X-band output
      frequency; Allan Deviation for the end-to-end non-coherent
      system was consistent with the 2E-13 measurements before
      launch.
 
      Each MOT also contained a separate, &apos;auxiliary&apos; oscillator
      which could be used to generate the non-coherent downlink
      carrier.  However, the frequency stability of the auxiliary
      oscillators was about six to seven orders of magnitude poorer
      than the USO.  They were, therefore, not applicable to these
      radio science investigations.
 
      The strength of a spacecraft carrier signal, and thus the
      quality of the radio occultation data, depends on its
      modulation state.  Mars Observer telemetry data were Manchester
      encoded and then used to modulate a 1 MHz square wave
      subcarrier which, in turn, modulated the X-band carrier.
      Telemetry modulation typically resulted in carrier suppression
      of either 15.2 dB (simultaneous transmission of science and
      engineering telemetry) or 9.3 dB (engineering telemetry only).
      The two-way ranging channel, when activated, suppressed the
      carrier by about 0.2 dB; the differential range modulation
      reduced the carrier by another 0.2 dB when in use.  Each
      modulation type -- telemetry, range, and differential range
      modulation -- could be switched on or off independently.
 
      Traveling wave tube amplifiers, driven at saturation, amplified
      the MOT output before the signals were radiated via (nominally)
      a steerable 1.5 m diameter parabolic high gain antenna (HGA).
      Effective isotropic radiated power was about 83 dBm.  In
      contrast to past practice for planetary missions, the HGA was
      mounted at the end of a 5.6 meter boom so that the phase center
      of the antenna was about 6 meters from the spacecraft center of
      mass.

        Tyler of Stanford University.
 
 
    Scientific Objectives
    =====================
      Two different types of radio science experiments were to be
      conducted with Mars Observer: radio tracking experiments in
      which the magnitude and direction of the planet&apos;s gravity field
      were derived from the Doppler and ranging measurements, and
      radio propagation experiments in which modulation on the signal
      received on Earth could be attributed to properties of an
      occulting medium, such as the atmosphere of Mars.
 
 
      Gravity Measurements
      --------------------
        Measurement of the gravity field provides significant
        constraints on inferences about interior structure of Mars.
        Precise, detailed study of the spacecraft motion in Mars
        orbit would have yielded the mass distribution of the planet.
        Topographic data obtained by the Mars Observer Laser
        Altimeter (MOLA) would have formed a critical adjunct to the
        measurements of the gravity field since only after the
        gravitational effects are adjusted for topography can the
        gravity anomalies be interpreted geophysically.  For example,
        our present understanding of the geometrical flattening is
        sufficiently uncertain that discussions as to whether or not
        Mars is in hydrostatic equilibrium cannot be conclusive until
        altimeter data are available; similarly, the large
        uncertainty in the precession constant precludes knowledge of
        individual moments of inertia.  Values for these basic
        quantities derived from Mars Observer would have been useful
        in studies of Mars&apos; internal stress, radial density, and
        internal temperature.
 
        Studies of the gravity field would have emphasized both the
        global field and local characteristics of the field.  The
        first task was to determine the global field.  Doppler and
        range tracking measurements spanning periods of several days
        would have yielded accurate spacecraft trajectory solutions.
        Simultaneously with reconstruction of the spacecraft orbit,
        observation equations for approximately 2500 field
        coefficients and a small number of ancillary parameters would
        have been derived.  This type of gravity field solution is
        essential for characterizing tectonic phenomena such as the
        Tharsis bulge and can also be used to study localized
        features.  Results were expected to be available some months
        after the data were collected, although the final global
        gravity field would not have been available for one or two
        years after the end of the Mission.
 
        &apos;Short-arc,&apos; line-of-sight Doppler tracking measurements
        obtained when the Earth-to-spacecraft line-of-sight was
        within a few degrees of the orbit plane were expected to
        provide the highest resolution of local features.  The
        results from this type of observation typically are presented
        as contoured acceleration profiles of specific features
        (e.g., craters, volcanoes, etc.) or line-of-sight
        acceleration maps of specific regions.  The high spatial
        resolution of these products makes them especially useful to
        geophysicists for study of features in the size range of 300
        to 1,000 km.  Because of the relative simplicity of the data
        analysis, results can be available within a few weeks after
        the data are collected.
 
 
      Radio Occultation Measurements
      ------------------------------
        Atmospheric measurements by the method of radio occultation
        were expected to contribute to an improved understanding of
        the circulation, dynamics, and the transport of volatiles and
        dust in the atmosphere of Mars.  These results would have
        been based on detailed analysis of the radio signal received
        from Mars Observer as it entered and exited occultation by
        the planet.  Two coordinated investigations of the atmosphere
        were planned within the Radio Science Team.  The first was to
        focus on obtaining vertical profiles of atmospheric structure
        with emphasis on investigation of large-scale phenomena,
        while the second was to concentrate on studies of the
        small-scale atmospheric structure that causes scintillations
        in the radio signal.
 
        Retrieval of atmospheric profiles requires coherent samples
        of the radio signal that has propagated through Mars&apos;
        atmosphere, plus accurate knowledge of the spacecraft
        trajectory.  The latter was to be obtained first from the
        Mars Observer Navigation Team and later, internally, from
        Radio Science Team gravity investigators.  Initial solutions
        were expected to provide atmospheric structure -- temperature
        and pressure vs.  absolute radius -- to altitudes of at least
        50 km with about 240 m vertical resolution; these &apos;standard&apos;
        profiles were expected within 2-4 weeks of data acquisition.
        After correction for diffractive propagation effects,
        vertical resolutions of 10-20 m might have been obtained.
        These &apos;high-resolution&apos; profiles require an increase in the
        complexity of retrieval algorithms, which were being revised
        when the spacecraft was lost.  Measures of total columnar
        content, surface pressure, planet radius at the occultation
        point, and properties of the ionosphere, if detectable, would
        have been obtained for each occultation.
 
        The spatial and temporal coverage in the radio occultation
        experiments would have been determined by the geometry of the
        spacecraft orbit.  In the mapping phase of the mission, the
        Mars Observer spacecraft was to circle Mars in a
        low-altitude, sun-synchronous, near-polar orbit with a period
        of about 117 min.  As most orbits of the spacecraft included
        an occultation by Mars, this trajectory provided frequent
        opportunities for radio occultation measurements of the
        neutral atmosphere and ionosphere.  The occultations
        generally occurred at high latitudes in both hemispheres.
        The rotation of the planet between successive orbits would
        have allowed systematic measurements at regular intervals of
        about 29 degrees in longitude.  Although most occultations
        were expected to be in polar regions, the view from Earth of
        the sun-synchronous spacecraft orbit would have evolved
        slowly in response to the orbital motions of Earth and Mars
        about the Sun, yielding opportunities for occultation
        measurements at a variety of latitudes and local times over
        the course of the 687-day mission.
 
 
    Operational Considerations
    ==========================
      Descriptions given here are for nominal performance.  The
      spacecraft transponder system comprised redundant units, each
      with slightly different characteristics.  As transponder units
      age, their performance changes slightly.  More importantly, the
      performance for Radio Science depended on operational factors
      such as the modulation state for the transmitters, which cannot
      be predicted in advance.  The performance also depended on
      factors which were not always under the control of the Mars
      Observer Project.
 
      During radio occultation periods, telemetry modulation would
      have been turned off; during many of the tests included in the
      Cruise data set telemetry was also suspended.  No special
      modulation requirements were required during routine tracking
      for trajectory determination.
 
      The steerable 1.5 m diameter parabolic high gain antenna (HGA)
      was mounted at the end of a 5.6 meter boom so that the phase
      center of the antenna was about 6 meters from the spacecraft
      center of mass.  An area of concern to the Mars Observer Radio
      Science and Navigation Teams was the set of &apos;pseudo-Doppler&apos;
      effects introduced into the radio tracking and occultation data
      by motion of the HGA relative to the spacecraft center of mass;
      it would have been necessary to remove these during data
      reduction before deriving the gravity field or occultation
      profiles.  Six sources of HGA motion were identified: (i) the
      spacecraft rotation needed to maintain nadir pointing while in
      orbit, (ii) articulation of the HGA to maintain Earth point,
      (iii) HGA boom flexure, (iv) short term migration of the
      spacecraft center of mass associated with effects such as
      &apos;sloshing&apos; of propellants and motions of articulating booms,
      (v) spacecraft attitude instability, and (vi) spacecraft
      response to cycling of momentum wheels.  The first two error
      sources are deterministic to the extent that their effects can
      be taken into account accurately with rather straightforward
      modeling.  Boom flexure was believed to be insignificant.
      Other motions of the spacecraft center of mass were studied;
      there were reasons to believe that they would not have proven
      to be major problems.
 
      Item (v) remained a concern at the time the spacecraft was
      lost.  When first analyzed in 1987, tracking error from this
      source alone was calculated to be nearly an order-of-magnitude
      greater than that from the next largest source.  For the normal
      &apos;mapping&apos; configuration, nadir pointing of the spacecraft would
      have been controlled by referencing spacecraft attitude to the
      Mars &apos;horizon&apos; as defined by carbon dioxide emissions from the
      atmosphere.  Atmospheric disturbances can affect determination
      of the horizon, however, causing the spacecraft attitude to
      deviate from the true nadir orientation.  Doppler error from
      HGA motion, then, can be coupled to atmospheric features, some
      of which are stable and associated with surface features (e.g.,
      the semi-permanent waves associated with the Tharsis volcanoes,
      and the winter polar hood).  This coupling would have made such
      signatures difficult or impossible to distinguish in the data
      from Doppler effects caused by the spacecraft response to
      gravity features.  After the 1987 analysis, attitude control
      design engineers at the spacecraft contractor (General
      Electric, AstroSpace Division) and at the Jet Propulsion
      Laboratory (JPL) implemented new control algorithms to reduce
      spacecraft attitude response to local atmospheric features.  By
      mid-1993, analytically predicted Doppler effects resulting from
      HGA motion relative to the spacecraft center of mass no longer
      represented the dominant error source for gravity field or
      atmospheric occultation measurements.  Predicted errors
      associated with the attitude control system remained
      significant, however, and study of this question was
      continuing.
 
      Item (vi) was identified as a potential source of error only
      after launch of Mars Observer.  Normal rotation of the
      spacecraft resulted in transfer of angular momentum among the
      on board momentum wheels.  At regular intervals, spaced by 90
      degrees of rotation, one set of wheels or another would pass
      through zero angular momentum and physically stop.  Static
      friction prevented smooth resumption of wheel rotation as the
      spacecraft continued turning; an attitude transient resulted,
      which could last for several minutes.  Modeling of these
      &apos;sticksion&apos; events based on reconstruction of attitude allowed
      most Doppler effects to be removed from non-coherent Cruise
      data.  But signal-to-noise ratios would have been considerably
      higher during Mapping, and the accuracy to which this could
      have been carried out under the best radio science observing
      conditions remained a concern.
 
 
    Calibration
    ===========
      No information is available on calibration of the radio system.
 
 
    Operational Modes
    =================

    Instrument Overview - DSN
    =========================
      Three Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) (near
      Barstow, CA; Canberra, Australia; and Madrid, Spain) comprise
      the DSN tracking network.  Each complex is equipped with
      several antennas [including at least one each 70-m, 34-m High
      Efficiency (HEF), and 34-m standard (STD)], associated
      electronics, and operational systems.  Primary activity at each
      complex is radiation of commands to and reception of telemetry
      data from active spacecraft.  Transmission and reception is
      possible in several radio-frequency bands, the most common
      being S-band (nominally a frequency of 2100-2300 MHz or a
      wavelength of 14.2-13.0 cm) and X-band (7100-8500 MHz or 4.2-
      3.5 cm).  Transmitter output powers of up to 400 kw are
      available.
 
      Ground stations have the ability to transmit coded and uncoded
      waveforms which can be echoed by distant spacecraft.  Analysis
      of the received coding allows navigators to determine the
      distance to the spacecraft; analysis of Doppler shift on the
      carrier signal allows estimation of the line-of-sight
      spacecraft velocity.  Range and Doppler measurements are used
      to calculate the spacecraft trajectory and to infer gravity
      fields of objects near the spacecraft.
 
      Ground stations can record spacecraft signals that have
      propagated through or been scattered from target media.
      Measurements of signal parameters after wave interactions with
      surfaces, atmospheres, rings, and plasmas are used to infer
      physical and electrical properties of the target.
 
      Principal investigators vary from experiment to experiment.
      See the corresponding section of the spacecraft instrument
      description or the data set description for specifics.
 
      The Deep Space Network is managed by the Jet Propulsion
      Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology for the
      U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

    Subsystems - DSN
    ================
      The Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) are an integral
      part of the Radio Science instrument, along with other
      receiving stations and the spacecraft Radio Frequency
      Subsystem.  Their system performance directly determines the
      degree of success of Radio Science investigations, and their
      system calibration determines the degree of accuracy in the
      results of the experiments.  The following paragraphs describe
      the functions performed by the individual subsystems of a DSCC.
      This material has been adapted from [ASMAR&amp;HERRERA1993]; for
      additional information, consult [DSN810-5].
 
      Each DSCC includes a set of antennas, a Signal Processing
      Center (SPC), and communication links to the Jet Propulsion
      Laboratory (JPL).  The general configuration is illustrated
      below; antennas (Deep Space Stations, or DSS -- a term carried
      over from earlier times when antennas were individually
      instrumented) are listed in the table.

      DSCC Monitor and Control Subsystem
      ----------------------------------
        The DSCC Monitor and Control Subsystem (DMC) is part of the
        Monitor and Control System (MON) which also includes the
        ground communications Central Communications Terminal and the
        Network Operations Control Center (NOCC) Monitor and Control
        Subsystem.  The DMC is the center of activity at a DSCC.  The
        DMC receives and archives most of the information from the
        NOCC needed by the various DSCC subsystems during their
        operation.  Control of most of the DSCC subsystems, as well
        as the handling and displaying of any responses to control
        directives and configuration and status information received
        from each of the subsystems, is done through the DMC.  The
        effect of this is to centralize the control, display, and
        archiving functions necessary to operate a DSCC.
        Communication between the various subsystems is done using a
        Local Area Network (LAN) hooked up to each subsystem via a
        network interface unit (NIU).
 
        DMC operations are divided into two separate areas: the
        Complex Monitor and Control (CMC) and the Link Monitor and
        Control (LMC).  The primary purpose of the CMC processor for
        Radio Science support is to receive and store all predict
        sets transmitted from NOCC such as Radio Science, antenna
        pointing, tracking, receiver, and uplink predict sets and
        then, at a later time, to distribute them to the appropriate
        subsystems via the LAN.  Those predict sets can be stored in
        the CMC for a maximum of three days under normal conditions.
        The CMC also receives, processes, and displays event/alarm
        messages; maintains an operator log; and produces tape labels
        for the DSP.  Assignment and configuration of the LMCs is
        done through the CMC; to a limited degree the CMC can perform
        some of the functions performed by the LMC.  There are two
        CMCs (one on-line and one backup) and three LMCs at each DSCC
        The backup CMC can function as an additional LMC if
        necessary.
 
        The LMC processor provides the operator interface for monitor
        and control of a link -- a group of equipment required to
        support a spacecraft pass.  For Radio Science, a link might
        include the DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP) (which,
        in turn, can control the SSI), or the Tracking Subsystem.
        The LMC also maintains an operator log which includes
        operator directives and subsystem responses.  One important
        Radio Science specific function that the LMC performs is
        receipt and transmission of the system temperature and signal
        level data from the PPM for display at the LMC console and
        for inclusion in Monitor blocks.  These blocks are recorded
        on magnetic tape as well as appearing in the Mission Control
        and Computing Center (MCCC) displays.  The LMC is required to
        operate without interruption for the duration of the Radio
        Science data acquisition period.
 
        The Area Routing Assembly (ARA), which is part of the Digital
        Communications Subsystem, controls all data communication
        between the stations and JPL.  The ARA receives all required
        data and status messages from the LMC/CMC and can record them
        to tape as well as transmit them to JPL via data lines.  The
        ARA also receives predicts and other data from JPL and passes
        them on to the CMC.
 
 
      DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem
      ---------------------------------
        Multi-mission Radio Science activities require support from
        the 70-m, 34-m HEF, and 34-m STD antenna subnets.  The
        antennas at each DSCC function as large-aperture collectors
        which, by double reflection, cause the incoming radio
        frequency (RF) energy to enter the feed horns.  The large
        collecting surface of the antenna focuses the incoming energy
        onto a subreflector, which is adjustable in both axial and
        angular position.  These adjustments are made to correct for
        gravitational deformation of the antenna as it moves between
        zenith and the horizon; the deformation can be as large as 5
        cm.  The subreflector adjustments optimize the channeling of
        energy from the primary reflector to the subreflector and
        then to the feed horns.  The 70-m and 34-m HEF antennas have
        &apos;shaped&apos; primary and secondary reflectors, with forms that
        are modified paraboloids.  This customization allows more
        uniform illumination of one reflector by another.  The 34-m
        STD primary reflectors are classical paraboloids, while the
        subreflectors are standard hyperboloids.
 
        On the 70-m and 34-m STD antennas, the subreflector directs
        received energy from the antenna onto a dichroic plate, a
        device which reflects S-band energy to the S-band feed horn
        and passes X-band energy through to the X-band feed horn.  In
        the 34-m HEF, there is one &apos;common aperture feed,&apos; which
        accepts both frequencies without requiring a dichroic plate.
        RF energy to be transmitted into space by the horns is
        focused by the reflectors into narrow cylindrical beams,
        pointed with high precision (either to the dichroic plate or
        directly to the subreflector) by a series of drive motors and
        gear trains that can rotate the movable components and their
        support structures.
 
        The different antennas can be pointed by several means.  Two
        pointing modes commonly used during tracking passes are
        CONSCAN and &apos;blind pointing.&apos; With CONSCAN enabled and a
        closed loop receiver locked to a spacecraft signal, the
        system tracks the radio source by conically scanning around
        its position in the sky.  Pointing angle adjustments are
        computed from signal strength information (feedback) supplied
        by the receiver.  In this mode the Antenna Pointing Assembly
        (APA) generates a circular scan pattern which is sent to the
        Antenna Control System (ACS).  The ACS adds the scan pattern
        to the corrected pointing angle predicts.  Software in the
        receiver-exciter controller computes the received signal
        level and sends it to the APA.  The correlation of scan
        position with the received signal level variations allows the
        APA to compute offset changes which are sent to the ACS.
        Thus, within the capability of the closed-loop control
        system, the scan center is pointed precisely at the apparent
        direction of the spacecraft signal source.  An additional
        function of the APA is to provide antenna position angles and
        residuals, antenna control mode/status information, and
        predict-correction parameters to the Area Routing Assembly
        (ARA) via the LAN, which then sends this information to JPL
        via the Ground Communications Facility (GCF) for antenna
        status monitoring.
 
        During periods when excessive signal level dynamics or low
        received signal levels are expected (e.g., during an
        occultation experiment), CONSCAN should not be used.  Under
        these conditions, blind pointing (CONSCAN OFF) is used, and
        pointing angle adjustments are based on a predetermined
        Systematic Error Correction (SEC) model.
 
        Independent of CONSCAN state, subreflector motion in at least
        the z-axis may introduce phase variations into the received
        Radio Science data.  For that reason, during certain
        experiments, the subreflector in the 70-m and 34-m HEFs may
        be frozen in the z-axis at a position (often based on
        elevation angle) selected to minimize phase change and signal
        degradation.  This can be done via Operator Control Inputs
        (OCIs) from the LMC to the Subreflector Controller (SRC)
        which resides in the alidade room of the antennas.  The SRC
        passes the commands to motors that drive the subreflector to
        the desired position.  Unlike the 70-m and 34-m HEFs which
        have azimuth-elevation (AZ-EL) drives, the 34-m STD antennas
        use (hour angle-declination) HA-DEC drives.  The same
        positioning of the subreflector on the 34-m STD does not
        create the same effect as on the 70-m and 34-m HEFs.
 
        Pointing angles for all three antenna types are computed by
        the NOCC Support System (NSS) from an ephemeris provided by
        the flight project.  These predicts are received and archived
        by the CMC.  Before each track, they are transferred to the
        APA, which transforms the direction cosines of the predicts
        into AZ-EL coordinates for the 70-m and 34-m HEFs or into
        HA-DEC coordinates for the 34-m STD antennas.  The LMC
        operator then downloads the antenna AZ-EL or HA-DEC predict
        points to the antenna-mounted ACS computer along with a
        selected SEC model.  The pointing predicts consist of
        time-tagged AZ-EL or HA-DEC points at selected time intervals
        along with polynomial coefficients for interpolation between
        points.
 
        The ACS automatically interpolates the predict points,
        corrects the pointing predicts for refraction and
        subreflector position, and adds the proper systematic error
        correction and any manually entered antenna offsets.  The ACS
        then sends angular position commands for each axis at the
        rate of one per second.  In the 70-m and 34-m HEF, rate
        commands are generated from the position commands at the
        servo controller and are subsequently used to steer the
        antenna.  In the 34-m STD antennas motors, rather than
        servos, are used to steer the antenna; there is no feedback
        once the 34-m STD has been told where to point.
 
        When not using binary predicts (the routine mode for
        spacecraft tracking), the antennas can be pointed using
        &apos;planetary mode&apos; -- a simpler mode which uses right ascension
        (RA) and declination (DEC) values.  These change very slowly
        with respect to the celestial frame.  Values are provided to
        the station in text form for manual entry.  The ACS
        quadratically interpolates among three RA and DEC points
        which are on one-day centers.
 
        A third pointing mode -- sidereal -- is available for
        tracking radio sources fixed with respect to the celestial
        frame.
 
        Regardless of the pointing mode being used, a 70-m antenna
        has a special high-accuracy pointing capability called
        &apos;precision&apos; mode.  A pointing control loop derives the main
        AZ-EL pointing servo drive error signals from a two- axis
        autocollimator mounted on the Intermediate Reference
        Structure.  The autocollimator projects a light beam to a
        precision mirror mounted on the Master Equatorial drive
        system, a much smaller structure, independent of the main
        antenna, which is exactly positioned in HA and DEC with shaft
        encoders.  The autocollimator detects elevation/cross-
        elevation errors between the two reference surfaces by
        measuring the angular displacement of the reflected light
        beam.  This error is compensated for in the antenna servo by
        moving the antenna in the appropriate AZ-EL direction.
        Pointing accuracies of 0.004 degrees (15 arc seconds) are
        possible in &apos;precision&apos; mode.  The &apos;precision&apos; mode is not
        available on 34-m antennas -- nor is it needed, since their
        beamwidths are twice as large as on the 70-m antennas.
 
 
      DSCC Antenna Microwave Subsystem
      --------------------------------
        70-m Antennas: Each 70-m antenna has three feed cones
        installed in a structure at the center of the main reflector.
        The feeds are positioned 120 degrees apart on a circle.
        Selection of the feed is made by rotation of the
        subreflector.  A dichroic mirror assembly, half on the S-band
        cone and half on the X-band cone, permits simultaneous use of
        the S- and X-band frequencies.  The third cone is devoted to
        R&amp;D and more specialized work.
 
        The Antenna Microwave Subsystem (AMS) accepts the received S-
        and X-band signals at the feed horn and transmits them
        through polarizer plates to an orthomode transducer.  The
        polarizer plates are adjusted so that the signals are
        directed to a pair of redundant amplifiers for each
        frequency, thus allowing simultaneous reception of signals in
        two orthogonal polarizations.  For S-band these are two Block
        IVA S-band Traveling Wave Masers (TWMs); for X-band the
        amplifiers are Block IIA TWMs.
 
        34-m STD Antennas: These antennas have two feed horns, one
        for S-band signals and one for X-band.  The horns are mounted
        on a cone which is fixed in relation to the subreflector.  A
        dichroic plate mounted above the horns directs energy from
        the subreflector into the proper horn.
 
        The AMS directs the received S- and X-band signals through
        polarizer plates and on to amplification.  There are two
        Block III S-band TWMs and two Block I X-band TWMs.
 
        34-m HEF Antennas: Unlike the other antennas, the 34-m HEF
        uses a single feed for both S- and X-band.  Simultaneous S-
        and X-band receive as well as X-band transmit is possible
        thanks to the presence of an S/X &apos;combiner&apos; which acts as a
        diplexer.  For S-band, RCP or LCP is user selected through a
        switch so neither a polarizer nor an orthomode transducer is
        needed.  X-band amplification options include two Block II
        TWMs or an HEMT Low Noise Amplifier (LNA).  S-band
        amplification is provided by an FET LNA.
 
 
      DSCC Receiver-Exciter Subsystem
      -------------------------------
        The Receiver-Exciter Subsystem is composed of three groups of
        equipment: the closed-loop receiver group, the open-loop
        receiver group, and the RF monitor group.  This subsystem is
        controlled by the Receiver-Exciter Controller (REC) which
        communicates directly with the DMC for predicts and OCI
        reception and status reporting.
 
        The exciter generates the S-band signal (or X-band for the
        34-m HEF only) which is provided to the Transmitter Subsystem
        for the spacecraft uplink signal.  It is tunable under
        command of the Digitally Controlled Oscillator (DCO) which
        receives predicts from the Metric Data Assembly (MDA).
 
        The diplexer in the signal path between the transmitter and
        the feed horn for all three antennas (used for simultaneous
        transmission and reception) may be configured such that it is
        out of the received signal path (in listen-only or bypass
        mode) in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the
        receiver system.
 
        Closed Loop Receivers: The Block IV receiver-exciter at the
        70-m stations allows for two receiver channels, each capable
        of L-Band (e.g., 1668 MHz frequency or 18 cm wavelength),
        S-band, or X-band reception, and an S-band exciter for
        generation of uplink signals through the low-power or
        high-power transmitter.  The Block III receiver-exciter at
        the 34-m STD stations allows for two receiver channels, each
        capable of S-band or X-band reception and an exciter used to
        generate an uplink signal through the low-power transmitter.
        The receiver-exciter at the 34-m HEF stations allows for one
        channel only.
 
        The closed-loop receivers provide the capability for rapid
        acquisition of a spacecraft signal and telemetry lockup.  In
        order to accomplish acquisition within a short time, the
        receivers are predict driven to search for, acquire, and
        track the downlink automatically.  Rapid acquisition
        precludes manual tuning though that remains as a backup
        capability.  The subsystem utilizes FFT analyzers for rapid
        acquisition.  The predicts are NSS generated, transmitted to
        the CMC which sends them to the Receiver-Exciter Subsystem
        where two sets can be stored.  The receiver starts
        acquisition at uplink time plus one round-trip-light-time or
        at operator specified times.  The receivers may also be
        operated from the LMC without a local operator attending
        them.  The receivers send performance and status data,
        displays, and event messages to the LMC.
 
        Either the exciter synthesizer signal or the simulation (SIM)
        synthesizer signal is used as the reference for the Doppler
        extractor in the closed-loop receiver systems, depending on
        the spacecraft being tracked (and Project guidelines).  The
        SIM synthesizer is not ramped; instead it uses one constant
        frequency, the Track Synthesizer Frequency (TSF), which is an
        average frequency for the entire pass.
 
        The closed-loop receiver AGC loop can be configured to one of
        three settings: narrow, medium, or wide.  It will be
        configured such that the expected amplitude changes are
        accommodated with minimum distortion.  The loop bandwidth
        (2BLo) will be configured such that the expected phase
        changes can be accommodated while maintaining the best
        possible loop SNR.
 
        Open-Loop Receivers: The Radio Science Open-Loop Receiver
        (OLR) is a dedicated four channel, narrow-band receiver which
        provides amplified and downconverted video band signals to
        the DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP).
 
        The OLR utilizes a fixed first Local Oscillator (LO)
        frequency and a tunable second LO frequency to minimize phase
        noise and improve frequency stability.  The OLR consists of
        an RF-to-IF downconverter located in the antenna, an IF
        selection switch (IVC), and a Radio Science IF-VF
        downconverter (RIV) located in the SPC.  The RF-IF
        downconverters in the 70-m antennas are equipped for four IF
        channels: S-RCP, S-LCP, X-RCP, and X-LCP.  The 34-m HEF
        stations are equipped with a two-channel RF-IF: S-band and
        X-band.  The IVC switches the IF input between the 70-m and
        34-m HEF antennas.
 
        The RIV contains the tunable second LO, a set of video
        bandpass filters, IF attenuators, and a controller (RIC).
        The LO tuning is done via DSP control of the POCA/PLO
        combination based on a predict set.  The POCA is a
        Programmable Oscillator Control Assembly and the PLO is a
        Programmable Local Oscillator (commonly called the DANA
        synthesizer).  The bandpass filters are selectable via the
        DSP.  The RIC provides an interface between the DSP and the
        RIV.  It is controlled from the LMC via the DSP.  The RIC
        selects the filter and attenuator settings and provides
        monitor data to the DSP.  The RIC could also be manually
        controlled from the front panel in case the electronic
        interface to the DSP is lost.
 
        RF Monitor -- SSI and PPM: The RF monitor group of the
        Receiver-Exciter Subsystem provides spectral measurements
        using the Spectral Signal Indicator (SSI) and measurements of
        the received channel system temperature and spacecraft signal
        level using the Precision Power Monitor (PPM).
 
        The SSI provides a local display of the received signal
        spectrum at a dedicated terminal at the DSCC and routes these
        same data to the DSP which routes them to NOCC for remote
        display at JPL for real-time monitoring and RIV/DSP
        configuration verification.  These displays are used to
        validate Radio Science Subsystem data at the DSS, NOCC, and
        Mission Support Areas.  The SSI configuration is controlled
        by the DSP and a duplicate of the SSI spectrum appears on the
        LMC via the DSP.  During real-time operations the SSI data
        also serve as a quick-look science data type for Radio
        Science experiments.
 
        The PPM measures system noise temperatures (SNT) using a
        Noise Adding Radiometer (NAR) and downlink signal levels
        using the Signal Level Estimator (SLE).  The PPM accepts its
        input from the closed-loop receiver.  The SNT is measured by
        injecting known amounts of noise power into the signal path
        and comparing the total power with the noise injection &apos;on&apos;
        against the total power with the noise injection &apos;off.&apos; That
        operation is based on the fact that receiver noise power is
        directly proportional to temperature; thus measuring the
        relative increase in noise power due to the presence of a
        calibrated thermal noise source allows direct calculation of
        SNT.  Signal level is measured by calculating an FFT to
        estimate the SNR between the signal level and the receiver
        noise floor where the power is known from the SNT
        measurements.
 
        There is one PPM controller at the SPC which is used to
        control all SNT measurements.  The SNT integration time can
        be selected to represent the time required for a measurement
        of 30K to have a one-sigma uncertainty of 0.3K or 1%.
 
 
      DSCC Transmitter Subsystem
      --------------------------
        The Transmitter Subsystem accepts the S-band frequency
        exciter signal from the Block III or Block IV Receiver-
        Exciter Subsystem exciter and amplifies it to the required
        transmit output level.  The amplified signal is routed via
        the diplexer through the feed horn to the antenna and then
        focused and beamed to the spacecraft.
 
        The Transmitter Subsystem power capabilities range from 18 kw
        to 400 kw.  Power levels above 18 kw are available only at
        70-m stations.
 
 
      DSCC Tracking Subsystem
      -----------------------
        The Tracking Subsystem primary functions are to acquire and
        maintain communications with the spacecraft and to generate
        and format radiometric data containing Doppler and range.
 
        The DSCC Tracking Subsystem (DTK) receives the carrier
        signals and ranging spectra from the Receiver-Exciter
        Subsystem.  The Doppler cycle counts are counted, formatted,
        and transmitted to JPL in real time.  Ranging data are also
        transmitted to JPL in real time.  Also contained in these
        blocks is the AGC information from the Receiver-Exciter
        Subsystem.  The Radio Metric Data Conditioning Team (RMDCT)
        at JPL produces an Archival Tracking Data File (ATDF) tape
        which contains Doppler and ranging data.
 
        In addition, the Tracking Subsystem receives from the CMC
        frequency predicts (used to compute frequency residuals and
        noise estimates), receiver tuning predicts (used to tune the
        closed-loop receivers), and uplink tuning predicts (used to
        tune the exciter).  From the LMC, it receives configuration
        and control directives as well as configuration and status
        information on the transmitter, microwave, and frequency and
        timing subsystems.
 
        The Metric Data Assembly (MDA) controls all of the DTK
        functions supporting the uplink and downlink activities.  The
        MDA receives uplink predicts and controls the uplink tuning
        by commanding the DCO.  The MDA also controls the Sequential
        Ranging Assembly (SRA).  It formats the Doppler and range
        measurements and provides them to the GCF for transmission to
        NOCC.
 
        The Sequential Ranging Assembly (SRA) measures the round trip
        light time (RTLT) of a radio signal traveling from a ground
        tracking station to a spacecraft and back.  From the RTLT,
        phase, and Doppler data, the spacecraft range can be
        determined.  A coded signal is modulated on an uplink carrier
        and transmitted to the spacecraft where it is detected and
        transponded back to the ground station.  As a result, the
        signal received at the tracking station is delayed by its
        round trip through space and shifted in frequency by the
        Doppler effect due to the relative motion between the
        spacecraft and the tracking station on Earth.
 
 
      DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP)
      ----------------------------------------
        The DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP) located at the
        SPC digitizes and records on magnetic tapes the narrowband
        output data from the RIV.  It consists of a Narrow Band
        Occultation Converter (NBOC) containing four Analog-to-
        Digital Converters (ADCs), a ModComp CLASSIC computer
        processor called the Spectrum Processing Assembly (SPA), and
        two to six magnetic tape drives.  Magnetic tapes are known as
        Original Data Records (ODRs).  Electronic near real-time
        transmission of data to JPL (an Original Data Stream, or ODS)
        may be possible in certain circumstances;
 
        The DSP is operated through the LMC.  Using the SPA-R
        software, the DSP allows for real-time frequency and time
        offsets (while in RUN mode) and, if necessary, snap tuning
        between the two frequency ranges transmitted by the
        spacecraft: coherent and non-coherent.  The DSP receives
        Radio Science frequency predicts from the CMC, allows for
        multiple predict set archiving (up to 60 sets) at the SPA,
        and allows for manual predict generation and editing.  It
        accepts configuration and control data from the LMC, provides
        display data to the LMC, and transmits the signal spectra
        from the SSI as well as status information to NOCC and the
        Project Mission Support Area (MSA) via the GCF data lines.
        The DSP records the digitized narrowband samples and the
        supporting header information (i.e., time tags, POCA
        frequencies, etc.) on 9-track magnetic tapes in 6250 or 1600
        bpi GCR format.
 
        Through the DSP-RIC interface the DSP controls the RIV filter
        selection and attenuation levels.  It also receives RIV
        performance monitoring via the RIC.  In case of failure of
        the DSP-RIC interface, the RIV can be controlled manually
        from the front panel.
 
        All the RIV and DSP control parameters and configuration
        directives are stored in the SPA in a macro-like file called
        an &apos;experiment directive&apos; table.  A number of default
        directives exist in the DSP for the major Radio Science
        experiments.  Operators can create their own table entries.
 
        Items such as verification of the configuration of the prime
        open-loop recording subsystem, the selection of the required
        predict sets, and proper system performance prior to the
        recording periods will be checked in real-time at JPL via the
        NOCC displays using primarily the remote SSI display at NOCC
        and the NRV displays.  Because of this, transmission of the
        DSP/SSI monitor information is enabled prior to the start of
        recording.  The specific run time and tape recording times
        will be identified in the Sequence of Events (SOE) and/or DSN
        Keyword File.
 
        The DSP can be used to duplicate ODRs.  It also has the
        capability to play back a certain section of the recorded
        data after conclusion of the recording periods.
 
 
      DSCC Frequency and Timing Subsystem
      -----------------------------------
        The Frequency and Timing Subsystem (FTS) provides all
        frequency and timing references required by the other DSCC
        subsystems.  It contains four frequency standards of which
        one is prime and the other three are backups.  Selection of
        the prime standard is done via the CMC.  Of these four
        standards, two are hydrogen masers followed by clean-up loops
        (CUL) and two are cesium standards.  These four standards all
        feed the Coherent Reference Generator (CRG) which provides
        the frequency references used by the rest of the complex.  It
        also provides the frequency reference to the Master Clock
        Assembly (MCA) which in turn provides time to the Time
        Insertion and Distribution Assembly (TID) which provides UTC
        and SIM-time to the complex.
 
        JPL&apos;s ability to monitor the FTS at each DSCC is limited to
        the MDA calculated Doppler pseudo-residuals, the Doppler
        noise, the SSI, and to a system which uses the Global
        Positioning System (GPS).  GPS receivers at each DSCC receive
        a one-pulse-per-second pulse from the station&apos;s (hydrogen
        maser referenced) FTS and a pulse from a GPS satellite at
        scheduled times.  After compensating for the satellite signal
        delay, the timing offset is reported to JPL where a database
        is kept.  The clock offsets stored in the JPL database are
        given in microseconds; each entry is a mean reading of
        measurements from several GPS satellites and a time tag
        associated with the mean reading.  The clock offsets provided
        include those of SPC 10 relative to UTC (NIST), SPC 40
        relative to SPC 10, etc.
 
 
    Optics - DSN
    ============
      Performance of DSN ground stations depends primarily on size of
      the antenna and capabilities of electronics.  These are
      summarized in the following set of tables.  Note that 64-m
      antennas were upgraded to 70-m between 1986 and 1989.
      Beamwidth is half-power full angular width.  Polarization is
      circular; L denotes left circular polarization (LCP), and R
      denotes right circular polarization (RCP).

      DSCC Open-Loop Receiver
      -----------------------
        The open loop receiver block diagram shown below is for 70-m
        and 34-m High-Efficiency (HEF) antenna sites.  Based on a
        tuning prediction file, the POCA controls the DANA
        synthesizer the output of which (after multiplication) mixes
        input signals at both S- and X-band to fixed intermediate
        frequencies for amplification.  These signals in turn are
        down converted and passed through additional filters until
        they yield baseband output of up to 25 kHz in width.  The
        baseband output is digitally sampled by the DSP and either
        written to magnetic tape or electronically transferred for
        further analysis.

    Detectors - DSN
    ===============
 
      DSCC Open-Loop Receivers
      ------------------------

        radio science investigator.

                 ------               ------------------------

                  1000                             4
 
 
 
    Calibration - DSN
    =================
      Calibrations of hardware systems are carried out periodically
      by DSN personnel; these ensure that systems operate at required
      performance levels -- for example, that antenna patterns,
      receiver gain, propagation delays, and Doppler uncertainties
      meet specifications.  No information on specific calibration
      activities is available.  Nominal performance specifications
      are shown in the tables above.  Additional information may be
      available in [DSN810-5].
 
      Prior to each tracking pass, station operators perform a series
      of calibrations to ensure that systems meet specifications for
      that operational period.  Included in these calibrations is
      measurement of receiver system temperature in the configuration
      to be employed during the pass.  Results of these calibrations
      are recorded in (hard copy) Controller&apos;s Logs for each pass.
 
      The nominal procedure for initializing open-loop receiver
      attenuator settings is described below.  In cases where widely
      varying signal levels are expected, the procedure may be
      modified in advance or real-time adjustments may be made to
      attenuator settings.
 
 
      Open-Loop Receiver Attenuation Calibration
      ------------------------------------------
        The open-loop receiver attenuator calibrations are performed
        to establish the output of the open-loop receivers at a level
        that will not saturate the analog-to-digital converters.  To
        achieve this, the calibration is done using a test signal
        generated by the exciter/translator that is set to the peak
        predicted signal level for the upcoming pass.  Then the
        output level of the receiver&apos;s video band spectrum envelope
        is adjusted to the level determined by equation (3) below (to
        five-sigma).  Note that the SNR in the equation (2) is in dB
        while the SNR in equation (3) is linear.
 
 
      Pn = -198.6 + 10*log(SNT) + 10*log(1.2*Fbw)              (1)
 
      SNR = Ps - Pn                               (SNR in dB)  (2)
 
      Vrms = sqrt(SNR + 1)/[1 + 0.283*sqrt(SNR)]  (SNR linear) (3)
 
      where    Fbw = receiver filter bandwidth (Hz)
               Pn  = receiver noise power (dBm)
               Ps  = signal power (dBm)
               SNT = system noise temperature (K)
               SNR = predicted signal-to-noise ratio
 
 
 
    Operational Considerations - DSN
    ================================
      The DSN is a complex and dynamic &apos;instrument.&apos; Its performance
      for Radio Science depends on a number of factors from equipment
      configuration to meteorological conditions.  No specific
      information on &apos;operational considerations&apos; can be given here.
 
 
    Operational Modes - DSN
    =======================
 
      DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem
      ---------------------------------
        Pointing of DSCC antennas may be carried out in several ways.
        For details see the subsection &apos;DSCC Antenna Mechanical
        Subsystem&apos; in the &apos;Subsystem&apos; section.  Binary pointing is
        the preferred mode for tracking spacecraft; pointing predicts
        are provided, and the antenna simply follows those.  With
        CONSCAN, the antenna scans conically about the optimum
        pointing direction, using closed-loop receiver signal
        strength estimates as feedback.  In planetary mode, the
        system interpolates from three (slowly changing) RA-DEC
        target coordinates; this is &apos;blind&apos; pointing since there is
        no feedback from a detected signal.  In sidereal mode, the
        antenna tracks a fixed point on the celestial sphere.  In
        &apos;precision&apos; mode, the antenna pointing is adjusted using an
        optical feedback system.  It is possible on most antennas to
        freeze z-axis motion of the subreflector to minimize phase
        changes in the received signal.
 
 
      DSCC Receiver-Exciter Subsystem
      -------------------------------
        The diplexer in the signal path between the transmitter and
        the feed horns on all three antennas may be configured so
        that it is out of the received signal path in order to
        improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the receiver system.
        This is known as the &apos;listen-only&apos; or &apos;bypass&apos; mode.
 
 
      Closed-Loop vs. Open-Loop Reception
      -----------------------------------
        Radio Science data can be collected in two modes: closed-
        loop, in which a phase-locked loop receiver tracks the
        spacecraft signal, or open-loop, in which a receiver samples
        and records a band within which the desired signal presumably
        resides.  Closed-loop data are collected using Closed-Loop
        Receivers, and open-loop data are collected using Open-Loop
        Receivers in conjunction with the DSCC Spectrum Processing
        Subsystem (DSP).  See the Subsystems section for further
        information.
 
 
      Closed-Loop Receiver AGC Loop
      -----------------------------
        The closed-loop receiver AGC loop can be configured to one of
        three settings: narrow, medium, or wide.  Ordinarily it is
        configured so that expected signal amplitude changes are
        accommodated with minimum distortion.  The loop bandwidth is
        ordinarily configured so that expected phase changes can be
        accommodated while maintaining the best possible loop SNR.
 
 
      Coherent vs. Non-Coherent Operation
      -----------------------------------
        The frequency of the signal transmitted from the spacecraft
        can generally be controlled in two ways -- by locking to a
        signal received from a ground station or by locking to an
        on-board oscillator.  These are known as the coherent (or
        &apos;two-way&apos;) and non-coherent (&apos;one-way&apos;) modes, respectively.
        Mode selection is made at the spacecraft, based on commands
        received from the ground.  When operating in the coherent
        mode, the transponder carrier frequency is derived from the
        received uplink carrier frequency with a &apos;turn-around ratio&apos;
        typically of 240/221.  In the non-coherent mode, the downlink
        carrier frequency is derived from the spacecraft on-board
        crystal-controlled oscillator.  Either closed-loop or
        open-loop receivers (or both) can be used with either
        spacecraft frequency reference mode.  Closed-loop reception
        in two-way mode is usually preferred for routine tracking.
        Occasionally the spacecraft operates coherently while two
        ground stations receive the &apos;downlink&apos; signal; this is
        sometimes known as the &apos;three-way&apos; mode.
 
 
      DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP)
      ----------------------------------------
        The DSP can operate in four sampling modes with from 1 to 4
        input signals.  Input channels are assigned to ADC inputs
        during DSP configuration.  Modes and sampling rates are
        summarized in the tables below:

    Measurement Parameters - DSN
    ============================
 
      Open-Loop System
      ----------------
        Output from the Open-Loop Receivers (OLRs), as sampled and
        recorded by the DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP), is
        a stream of 8- or 12-bit quantized voltage samples.  The
        nominal input to the Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) is
        +/-10 volts, but the precise scaling between input voltages
        and output digitized samples is usually irrelevant for
        analysis; the digital data are generally referenced to a
        known noise or signal level within the data stream itself --
        for example, the thermal noise output of the radio receivers
        which has a known system noise temperature (SNT).  Raw
        samples comprise the data block in each DSP record; a header
        record (presently 83 16-bit words) contains ancillary
        information such as:
 
        time tag for the first sample in the data block RMS values of
        receiver signal levels and ADC outputs POCA frequency and
        drift rate
 
 
      Closed-Loop System
      ------------------
        Closed-loop data are recorded in Archival Tracking Data Files
        (ATDFs), as well as certain secondary products such as the
        Orbit Data File (ODF).  The ATDF Tracking Logical Record
        contains 117 entries including status information and
        measurements of ranging, Doppler, and signal strength.
