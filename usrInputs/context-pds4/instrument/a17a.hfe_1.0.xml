  Instrument Overview
  ===================
    The Heat Flow Experiment (HFE), part of the Apollo Lunar Surface
    Experiment Package (ALSEP), was designed to determine the rate of heat
    loss from the lunar interior by temperature and thermal property
    measurements at and below the surface. The experiment was carried on
    the Apollo 15, 16, and 17 missions and was essentially identical on all
    three missions.  (The experiment was attempted during Apollo 16 but
    failed due to a broken cable connection.) The experiment apparatus
    consisted of two probes connected by 8 meter long cables to an
    electronics box which was in turn connected by a flat ribbon cable to
    the ALSEP station. The astronauts would drill two holes with the Apollo
    Lunar Surface Drill (ALSD). The ALSD was equipped with borestem caps
    and retainers, borestems, bore bits, a bore bit/drill adapter, a
    treadle, and a bore stem/core stem wrench. The borestem assemblies used
    in drilling consisted of lengths of hollow fiberglass tubes, 2.5 cm in
    diameter, which would be connected together as the drilling progressed,
    and remained in the holes to provide a casing to prevent collapse of
    the hole walls during insertion of the probes. Nominally the holes were
    to be drilled to a depth of 3 meters but in practice no holes reached
    this depth. The probe would be lowered down into the borestem until it
    came to rest on top of the drill bit at the bottom of the hole. The
    borestem tube would project out of the surface a distance dependent on
    the depth of the hole.
 
 
    Heat Flow Probes
    ----------------
      Each heat flow probe was constructed of two rigid cylinders connected
      by a flexible joint. Each cylinder was 50 cm in length and held four
      platinum resistance elements which were electrically connected in
      pairs to form two accurate (+/-0.001 K) differential thermometers.
      The first pair of elements were located with one element near the top
      and one near the bottom of the cylinder, 47 cm apart from each other,
      and were connected in a bridge circuit. These sensors were designated
      the gradient bridge (DTG). The other two sensors were located 9 cm
      below the top DTG sensor and 9 cm above the bottom DTG sensor, 29 cm
      apart from each other connected by a bridge circuit. This pair was
      designated the ring bridge (DTR).
 
      A thermocouple (the probe thermocouple) was mounted near the top of
      the upper cylinder, colocated with the top gradient sensor. Attached
      to the top of the upper cylinder was a long flexible cable which
      connected the probe to the electronics box.  The cable contained 3
      more thermocouples spaced 65 cm, 115 cm, and 165 cm from the probe
      thermocouple. The thermocouples were spaced so that at least some of
      them were outside the borehole on the lunar surface.
 
      1000-ohm Karma-wire platinum resistor heaters surrounded each of the
      four gradient bridge sensor housings on each probe. These were used
      for conductivity experiments and could be energized at either 0.002 W
      (low conductivity mode) or 0.5 W (high conductivity mode). The
      heaters would be turned on for approximately 36 hours for the low
      conductivity experiments and 6 hours in high conductivity mode.
 
      The probes return absolute temperature data, differential temperature
      data (across the bridges), low- and high-thermal conductivity data,
      and thermocouple temperature data. Specifically, the experiment
      measured lunar temperatures of the following types, with
      corresponding accuracies noted in parentheses -- gradient bridge
      high-sensitivity temperature difference  measurements (0.001 K)
      low-sensitivity temperature difference measurements (0.01 K), and
      absolute temperature measurements (0.05 K) over the temperature range
      190 - 270 K; ring bridge temperature difference measurements (0.002
      K) and absolute temperatures (0.05 K) over the range 190 - 270 K;
      thermocouple temperatures (0.07 K) over 70 - 400 K; and the reference
      bridge temperature (0.01 K) over 23 - 363 K.
 
      The electronics box contained two multiplexers and amplifiers, dc/dc
      converter, and an isothermal block which contained a reference
      thermocouple and reference bridge.  The electronics box was nominally
      kept at 278 to 328 K using heating elements, power control
      thermostats, a layered aluminized mylar insulation bag. fiberglass
      case, radiator plate, and sunshield.  The instrument was powered by
      29 volt d.c. from the central station.
 
 
    Sensor Naming Convention
    ------------------------
      The sensors were designated with a 6 character code, three letters
      followed by two numbers and one letter.  The first of the two numbers
      designates the probe number. The sensors on probe 1 were individually
      designated as follows;  for the upper cylinder the second number is
      &apos;1&apos;, the upper gradient bridge sensor was DTG11A and the lower sensor
      was DTG11B; the upper ring bridge sensor was DTR11A and the lower
      DTR11B. For the lower cylinder the second number was 2, the upper
      gradient bridge sensor was DTG12A, the lower DTG12B, and the upper
      ring bridge sensor was DTR12A, the lower DTR12B.  The bridge sensor
      pairs were designated DTG11, DTR11, DTG12, and DTR12. The sensors on
      probe 2 had the same format except that the first number in each
      designation was replaced with a &apos;2&apos;, so the upper cylinder, upper
      gradient bridge sensor was DTG21A. Two numbering conventions exist in
      the literature for the thermocouples.  We are using the convention
      that TC14 designates the thermocouple at the top of probe 1, TC13 is
      the cable thermocouple closest to probe 1, followed by TC12 and TC11.
      Probe 2 would have TC24, etc. (Another convention, seen in the
      Preliminary Science Reports, has the probe thermocouple designated as
      TC11, followed successively in the cable by TC14, TC13, and TC12.)
 
 
    Instrument Operation
    --------------------
      In normal operating mode a 7.25 minute measurement sequence is used
      to collect the ambient high- and low-sensitivity differential data
      from the gradient sensors and the thermocouple outputs. The same
      measurement sequence would be used when the heaters were commanded on
      for the low conductivity (0.002 W) mode, with the heaters activated
      in turn for typically 36 hours.  For the high-conductivity (0.5 W)
      sequence, the ring bridge sensors were used and were read every 54
      seconds. This mode nominally would last 8 hours.  This mode could
      also be done without the heaters on, with measurements simply being
      made by the ring bridge sensors.  This mode, known as a ring bridge
      survey, would be used approximately every 6 hours at first and less
      frequently later in the experiment.  The measurement time intervals
      for a given sensor would vary over the course of its operation,
      such that the time sequences in resulting data do not necessarily
      follow a linear pattern.
 
 
    Apollo 17 Operational History
    -----------------------------
      The Apollo 17 heat flow electronics box was set up 12.3 meters north
      of the ALSEP central station with the hole for probe 1 drilled 5.7
      meters east of the box and the probe 2 hole drilled 5.4 meters west
      of the box. Both holes were drilled about 250 cm into the lunar
      regolith. For probe 1 the sensors were at the following depths:
      DTG12B - 233 cm; DTR12B - 224 cm; DTR12A - 194 cm; DTG12A - 185 cm;
      DTG11B - 177 cm; DTR11B - 168 cm; DTR11A - 139 cm; DTG11A - 130 cm.
      Cable thermocouple TC13 was at a depth of 66 cm in the borehole, TC12
      was right at the top of the hole, and TC11 was out on the surface.
      For probe 2 the sensors were at depths of: DTG22B - 234 cm; DTR22B -
      225 cm; DTR22A - 195 cm; DTG22A - 186 cm; DTG21B - 178 cm; DTR21B -
      169 cm; DTR21A - 140 cm; DTG21A - 131 cm. Cable thermocouple TC23 was
      at a depth of 67 cm in the borehole, TC22 was right at the top of the
      hole, and TC21 was out on the surface. Probe 1 was placed in the hole
      on 12 December 1972 at approximately 02:44 UT. The instrument was
      turned on at 03:02:00 UT and the first reading from probe 1 came at
      03:05:48.  Probe 2 was emplaced at 03:08. The first readings from
      probe 2 came at 03:08:28. On 18 February 1977 an anomaly occurred in
      probe 2 at the 230 cm level.  The instrument was commanded off along
      with the other ALSEP experiments on 30 September 1977.
 
 
    Heater schedule
    ---------------
      The heaters were turned on and off in the low power (0.002 W) mode in
      January 1973 as follows, with the heater designation followed in
      parentheses by the depth of the heater, the date and time the heater
      was turned on, and the date and time the heater was turned off, in
      UT. For probe 1: H11 (130 cm, 3 Jan. 05:58 - 4 Jan. 18:00); H12 (177
      cm, 14 Jan. 00:03 - 15 Jan. 11:48); H13 (185 cm, 21 Jan. 00:03 - 22
      Jan. 12:31); H14 (233 cm, 8 Jan. 06:21 - 9 Jan. 16:02). For probe
      2: H21 (131 cm, 5 Jan. 05:18 - 7 Jan. 06:07); H22 (178 cm, 16 Jan.
      12:06 - 18 Jan. 00:05); H23 (186 cm, 23 Jan. 00:31 - 24 Jan. 12:30);
      H24 (234 cm, 10 Jan. 05:59 - 11 Jan. 17:59). On 25 January at 18:00
      UT H14 was turned on at high power, 0.5 W, and was shut off at 20:30
      UT. The ring bridge DTR12 went off scale high.
