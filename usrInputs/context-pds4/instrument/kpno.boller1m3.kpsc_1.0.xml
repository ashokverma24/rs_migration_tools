    <description>The Single-channel Polarimeter was put into service for the Kitt Peak 36- and 50-inch
telescopes in August 1969.  It is similar to one built at the Crimean Astrophysical
Observatory (Shakhovskoy and Dymov 1962).  The main element of the device is a
rapidly rotating polarizer mounted in a circular disk containing 100 radial slots
spaced uniformly around the perimeter.  The disk serves to encode the angular
position of the polarizer.

A star-chopping technique is used to compensate for sky brightness by means of a pair
of closely matched diaphragms in the focal plane.  The remainder of the polarimeter
includes a moveable filter slide immediately following the polarizer, and then a Lyot
depolarizer.  The final optical element is a CuSO4-5H2O crystal in a moveable slide
which is used to eliminate red leaks from the shorter-wavelength filters.

The observing procedure is to place a star in one diaphragm with an area of adjacent
sky in the other.  Small systematic differences between the two beams are eliminated
by periodically switching the star from one diaphragm to the other during an
observation.  The observer is aided by an oscilloscope display of the accumulated
intensity as a function of polarizer position angle.

For further information about the instrument, including a schematic diagram, see Dyck
and Sandford (1971).
