    Instrument Description
    ======================
      The Voyager Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) is a modified
      version of the slow scan vidicon camera designs that were used
      in the earlier Mariner flights.  The system consists of two
      cameras, a high resolution Narrow Angle (NA) camera and a lower
      resolution, more sensitive Wide Angle (WA) camera.  Unlike the
      other on board instruments, operation of the cameras is not
      autonomous, but is controlled by an imaging parameter table
      residing in one of the spacecraft computers, the Flight Data
      Subsystem (FDS) (Science and Mission Systems Handbook, 1987,
      JPL D-498, an internal JPL document available from JPL vellum
      files).
 
      The original mission was to Jupiter and Saturn.  Voyager
      surpassed expectations and Voyager 2 went on to encounter
      Uranus and Neptune.  As the Voyager mission progressed the
      objects photographed were further from the sun so they appear
      more faint even though longer exposures were used.  As the
      Voyager spacecrafts&apos; distance from the Earth increases, the
      telecommunications capability at each encounter decreases.  The
      difference in capabilities from the Jupiter and Saturn
      encounters and that at Uranus and Neptune was considerable.
      The reduced telecommunications capability limits the number of
      data modes that imaging can use.  Because of the diminished
      brightness of the objects being photographed, longer exposure
      times were used, many beyond the stated maximum of 15.360
      seconds.  Longer exposure times were all 48-second increments
      added to the maximum.  In addition, the camera was slewed in
      order to avoid smeared imaging.  The light flood state (on/off)
      was independent of the instrument mode.
 
 
    Science Objectives
    ==================
      The overall objective of this experiment is exploratory
      reconnaissance of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and their
      satellites and rings.  Such reconnaissance, at resolutions and
      phase angles unobtainable from Earth, provides much new data
      relevant to the atmospheric and/or surface properties of these
      bodies.  The experiment also has the following specific
      objectives: observe and characterize global circulation and
      meteorology; determine the horizontal and vertical structure of
      visible clouds; characterize the nature of any colored material
      which may be in clouds.
 
 
    Operational Considerations
    ==========================
      To make full scientific use of the image collection it is
      necessary to understand the radiometric and geometric
      characteristics of the camera system and perform corrections to
      the data.
 
      Each Voyager camera is unique in terms of its calibrated
      characteristics.  Each has intrinsic shading (spatially
      non-uniform output DNs from flat field target) and exhibits
      barrel distortions typical of TV cameras flown on previous
      planetary missions.  Because of these characteristics, the
      cameras were calibrated before launch.  The response of the
      pixels to known targets, illumination, exposures, etc.  was
      measured and Calibration Files were generated to remove
      radiometric and geometric distortions from the flight images.
      These Calibration Files and detailed information on their use
      are available through the Imaging Node.
 
 
    Calibration Description
    =======================
      The calibration program for the Voyager television cameras
      consisted of three parts: (1) component calibrations; (&apos;Voyager
      Imaging Science Subsystem Calibration Report&apos; July 31, 1978, M.
      Benesh and P.  Jepsen, D-618-802) (2) subsystem calibrations;
      and, (3) system calibrations.  In addition, provision was made
      for in-flight calibrations.  Component calibrations were
      carried out prior to camera assembly.  Important measurements
      include spectral transmittance of the lens and filters, actual
      exposure times and shading characteristics of the shutter, and
      pertinent electro-optical properties of the vidicon.  After the
      optics and sensor were assembled it was possible to run
      calibrations at the camera, or subsystem, level.  Particular
      activities accomplished during this period included radiometric
      calibrations, focal length measurement, determination of the
      modulation transfer function, measurement of the geometric
      distortion, and calibrations required for color reconstruction.
      System calibrations were conducted after the cameras were
      installed on the spacecraft.  Important tasks included
      measurement of the Field-Of-View alignment and verification of
      the flat-field light transfer characteristics.  Noise
      measurements were also made at the system level.
 
      A method for in-flight verification of the radiometric
      calibrations that were run on the ground is employed on the
      Narrow-Angle optics.  It is very similar to the scheme used on
      the Wide-Angle optics except that eight lamps are required.
      They are located just within the field of view around the
      periphery of the telescope aperture.  By either pulsing the
      lamps or leaving them on and varying the shutter exposure time
      a transfer curve may also be generated by using the calibration
      plaque.  The method is identical to that described for the
      wide-angle optics.  However, calibration data was collected but
      no new calibration files were generated during the Jupiter,
      Saturn, or Uranus encounters or their related cruise periods.
 
      Although the INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER_NAME has been provided as
      Radiance, the Voyager Experiment Data Record (EDR) data set has
      not been radiometrically corrected, and thus images do not
      represent radiance units.  In order to convert an image from
      Data Number (DN) to radiance units, the image must be
      calibrated.  Radiometric calibration files, and selected
      radiometrically corrected images are available through the
      Imaging Node.

      Description
      -----------
        The sensor used in the Voyager - Imaging Science Subsystem
        (ISS) camera system is a 25-mm diameter magnetic and
        deflection vidicon (number B41-003, General Electro-dynamics
        Company).  The vidicon storage surface (target) is selenium
        sulphur and can store a high resolution (1500 TV lines)
        picture for over 100 s at room temperature.  The active image
        area on the target is 11.14 x 11.14 mm.  Each frame consists
        of 800 lines with 800 picture elements (pixels) per line,
        i.e., 1 pixel =14 microns.  One frame requires 48 s for
        electronic readout.  In addition to the normal frame readout
        of 48 s (1:1), four extended frame-time modes of 2:1, 3:1,
        5:1, and 10:1 are available by command.  Following readout,
        light flooding is used to remove any residual image that
        might remain from the previous frame.  At the end of light
        flooding, 14 erase frames are used to stabilize and prepare
        the vidicon target for the next exposure sequence (VGR ISS
        Calibration Report, 1978, an internal JPL document available
        from JPL vellum files).
 
 
      Sensitivity
      -----------
        Calibration experiments show the gain map indicating higher
        sensitivity toward the top of the frame in a generally radial
        manner.  Dark-current ratio results indicate a mean within
        plus-or-minus 3% of the true linearity of the light transfer
        function.  The required accuracy of the light-transfer
        functions was plus-or-minus 5% of half-scale signal averaged
        over any randomly selected area of 10 contiguous pixels.
        This requirement was consistently met for all Imaging Science
        Subsystem (ISS) flight cameras.  The radiance of the used
        light cannons was supposed to be plus-or-minus 5% or better
        of the level to produce a half-scale signal.  This criterion
        was also met.  It is not clear whether the color spatial
        dependence is due to the vidicon, or whether the filters have
        varying transmissions.  In the latter case, the ratios would
        be independent of light level; and this has been observed to
        be the case for all flight cameras.  Moreover, vidicons have
        not shown scale variations of this magnitude in the past, so
        that it is easier to believe that they are due to the
        spectral filters rather than to the vidicons.  The color
        sensitivity is sufficient to require a separate decalibration
        file for each spectral filter, which has been done, but not
        gross enough to cause concern about the quality of the image
        itself (VGR ISS Calibration Report, 1978, an internal JPL
        document available from JPL vellum files).

        The Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) electronics consist of
        the vidicon support circuits and the signal chain.  The
        vidicon support circuits are the vertical and horizontal
        sweep circuits, and the various power supplies for the
        vidicon filament, and the focus and alignment coils.  The
        signal chain consists of the analog signal amplifiers,
        bandpass filters, and an eight bit analog-to-digital
        converter.  The digital output is sent to the Flight Data
        Subsystem (FDS) for editing.

        The measurements recorded below are the coordinates
        representing the center of the Wide Angle Field Of View (FOV)
        in relation to the center of the Narrow Angle FOV.  As of
        5/26/88 the Voyager 2 scan platform offset values were
        updated and the removal of all extraneous offset values for
        VG1 and VG2 accomplished.  Only the most recently input
        values remain in the database for each spacecraft.  These
        values are effective for all periods of data inclusive from
        launch to present.  (June 7, 1989).
