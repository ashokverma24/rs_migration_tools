    Instrument Overview
    ===================
      The Clementine spacecraft telecommunications subsystem
      served as part of a Radio Science instrument for
      investigations of the Moon.  The remainder of the
      &apos;instrument&apos; was located at ground stations of the NASA Deep
      Space Network (DSN).  Much of the equipment at both ends was
      shared, being used for routine telecommunications as well as
      for Radio Science.  Radio data were themselves shared;
      Doppler and range measurements were used to calculate the
      spacecraft trajectory and to infer the lunar gravity field.
      Measurements of signal parameters after waves had interacted
      with the lunar surface were used to infer physical and
      electrical properties of the surface material.
 
 
    Instrument Overview - Spacecraft
    ================================
      The spacecraft telecommunications subsystem provided
      simultaneous radio frequency (RF) uplink, downlink, and
      coherent tracking capabilities with DSN ground stations
      [REGEONETAL1994].  Clementine used two S-band (2.0-2.3 GHz)
      omni-directional antennas for low data rate communications
      and a body-fixed 1.1 m diameter composite parabolic
      reflector with a deployable feed for high data rate
      communications.  The omni antennas were configured such that
      commands could be received over a wide range of spacecraft
      orientations.  Two S-Band transponder units provided the
      transmit and receive functions for the spacecraft.  Each
      transponder contained one exciter and solid-state
      transmitter and one fixed-tuned phase-locked loop receiver
      (2093.0542 MHz).  In addition, the subsystem contained three
      diplexers, two 10 dB couplers, and a transfer switch.

      Both spacecraft receivers were powered on at all times
      during the mission.  Ranging signals, uplinked independently
      or during commanding, were demodulated by the receiver and
      passed on to the transmitter for re-transmission to Earth.
      The receiver&apos;s automatic gain control was commanded off to
      allow tracking of the uplink signal through nulls in the
      antenna pattern as the spacecraft spun.
 
      The exact frequency of the signal transmitted from the
      spacecraft could be controlled in two ways -- by locking to
      a signal received from a ground station or by locking to an
      on-board oscillator.  These are known as the coherent (or
      &apos;two-way&apos;) and non-coherent (&apos;one-way&apos;) modes, respectively.
      When operating in the coherent mode, the transponder carrier
      frequency was derived from the received uplink carrier
      frequency with a &apos;turn-around ratio&apos; of 240/221.  In the
      non-coherent mode, the downlink carrier frequency was
      derived from the spacecraft on-board crystal-controlled
      oscillator.  After a 3-hour warm-up, the nominal crystal
      oscillator frequency was 2273.000+/-0.002 MHz.
 
      Solid state amplifiers, driven at saturation, amplified the
      multiplier output before the signals were radiated via
      either the high-gain parabolic antenna or the low gain omni-
      directional antennas.  The signal transmitted by each of the
      Clementine antennas was right circularly polarized.
 
      Pertinent details of the subsystem are shown below; its
      &apos;build date&apos; is taken to be 1994-01-01, which was during the
      Pre-Launch phase of the Clementine mission.

      Platform Mounting Descriptions
      ------------------------------
      The spacecraft +Z axis vector was in the nominal direction
      of the instrument sensor panel.  The +X axis vector was
      parallel to the nominal direction of the main thruster
      nozzle, and the -X axis vector was parallel to the
      spacecraft high-gain antenna (HGA) boresight.  The +Y axis
      vector formed a right-handed coordinate system and was in
      the nominal direction of the solar panel rotation axis.  The
      low-gain &apos;omni-directional&apos; antennas were mounted on the +Z
      and -Z sides of the spacecraft body.  The spacecraft
      velocity vector was in approximately the -X direction when
      the spacecraft was oriented for nadir viewing.  The nominal
      HGA S-band polarization was right-hand circular in the -X
      direction.

      Principal Investigators
      -----------------------
      The Principal Investigators for the gravity investigations
      were David E. Smith and Maria T. Zuber.  The Principal
      Investigator for the radio occultation and radio scattering
      experiments was Christopher L. Lichtenberg.
 
 
    Scientific Objectives
    =====================
      Two different types of radio science experiments were
      conducted with Clementine: radio tracking experiments in
      which the magnitude and direction of the planet&apos;s gravity
      field were derived from the Doppler and ranging
      measurements, and radio propagation experiments in which
      modulation on the signal received on Earth could be
      attributed to properties of the intervening medium.  Two
      types of radio propagation experiments were carried out:
      radio occultations by the lunar limb and scattering from the
      lunar surface.
 
        Gravity Measurements
        --------------------
        Measurement of the gravity field provides significant
        constraints on inferences about interior structure of the
        Moon.  Precise, detailed study of the spacecraft motion in
        lunar orbit can yield the mass distribution of the target
        body.  Topographic data obtained by the Clementine laser
        altimeter forms a critical adjunct to these measurements
        since only after the gravitational effects are adjusted
        for topography can the gravity anomalies be interpreted
        geophysically [ZUBERETAL1994].
 
        Studies of the gravity field emphasize both the global
        field and local characteristics of the field.  The first
        task is to determine the global field.  Doppler and range
        tracking measurements yield accurate spacecraft trajectory
        solutions.  Simultaneously with reconstruction of the
        spacecraft orbit, observation equations for field
        coefficients and a small number of ancillary parameters
        can be solved [BALMINO1981].  This type of gravity field
        solution is essential for characterizing large scale
        phenomena and can also be used to study localized
        features.
 
        &apos;Short-arc&apos; line-of-sight Doppler tracking measurements
        obtained when the Earth-to-spacecraft line-of-sight is
        within a few degrees of the orbit plane provide the
        highest resolution of local features.  The results from
        this type of observation typically are presented as
        contoured acceleration profiles of specific features
        (e.g., craters, ridges, etc.) or line-of-sight
        acceleration maps of specific regions.  The high spatial
        resolution of these products makes them especially useful
        to geophysicists for study of features in the size range
        of 300 to 1,000 km.  Because of the relative simplicity of
        the data analysis, results can be available within a few
        days after the data are collected [SJOGRENETAL1976].
 
 
        Radio Occultation Measurements
        ------------------------------
        Radio measurements during occultations can provide
        information on topography along the target body limb.
        When combined with accurate reconstructions of the
        spacecraft trajectory, the time at which occultation
        occurs provides a precise estimate of the occultation
        point distance from the target center-of-mass
        [LINDALETAL1979].  Differences between the ideal
        diffraction signature expected from a &apos;knife-edge&apos;
        opaque screen can also be used to infer details of
        surface structure in the vicinity of the limb.
 
 
        Bistatic Surface Scattering Measurements
        ----------------------------------------
        When the spacecraft telecommunications antenna is pointed
        toward the surface of the target, the strength of the
        scattered signal from the illuminated area may be
        interpreted in terms of the texture of the surface at that
        point [SIMPSON1993].  In experiments conducted on
        1994-04-10, the Clementine high-gain antenna was aimed
        toward a single target area -- the lunar south pole (the
        so-called &apos;spotlight mode&apos;) -- and the scattered signal
        was recorded at DSN stations in California, Australia,
        and Spain as the spacecraft moved in its orbit.  On
        1993-04-23, the spacecraft high-gain antenna was aimed
        toward the lunar north pole in another spotlight
        experiment; those signals were received at the Canberra
        and Madrid DSN sites.  On 1994-04-23 the spacecraft
        antenna was also aimed toward the specular point on the
        lunar surface for part of a single orbit (the &apos;quasi-
        specular&apos; experiment mode).  In that case, the mirror-like
        reflected signal was received at the DSN station near
        Madrid; the quasi-specular echo is much stronger than the
        echo obtained in other configurations.
 
        Spotlight experiments, conducted on polar targets were
        designed to detect and measure enhanced backscatter from
        possible ice deposits in areas permanently shaded from
        solar illumination.  Such enhancements have been seen in
        Earth-based radar studies of the Galilean satellites
        [CAMPBELLETAL1978], Mars [MUHLEMANETAL1991], and Mercury
        [HARMONETAL1994].  Although Earth-based radar studies of
        the Moon [STACY1993] have had considerably better
        sensitivity and surface resolution than this experiment,
        the Clementine geometry uniquely allowed measurements as a
        function of the bistatic angle -- the separation angle
        between transmitter and receiver [SIMPSON1993].  The
        angular variation of any enhancement may be related to
        the distance the radar signal travels through the ice and,
        hence, to the thickness and/or clarity of the ice at 13 cm
        wavelength.
 
 
    Operational Considerations
    ==========================
      Descriptions given here are for nominal performance.  The
      spacecraft transponder system comprised redundant units,
      each with slightly different characteristics.  As
      transponder units age, their performance changes slightly.
      More importantly, the performance for Radio Science depended
      on operational factors such as the modulation state for the
      transmitters, which cannot be predicted in advance.  The
      performance also depended on factors which were not always
      under the control of the Clementine Project.
 
      Clementine telemetry data were sent to Earth at user
      selectable rates between 125 bits per second and 125
      kilobits per second.  During radio occultation and radio
      scattering experiment periods, telemetry modulation was
      usually turned off; no special modulation requirements were
      applied during tracking for gravity field determination.
 
 
    Calibration
    ===========
      No information is available on calibration of the radio
      system.
 
      Measurements of the high gain antenna radiation pattern were
      made on an engineering model of the antenna.
 
 
    Operational Modes
    =================
      The Clementine telecommunications system could be viewed as
      having two sections, which could be operated in the
      following modes:

      Oscillator   two-way (coherent)
                   one-way (non-coherent)
      RF output    low-gain antenna
                   high-gain antenna
 
      Selected parameters describing transponder performance are
      listed below:
 
      Oscillator Parameters:                      S-Band
         Two-Way Transponder Turnaround Ratio     240/221

           Polarization                           Right Circular
 
 
    Instrument Overview - DSN
    =========================
      Three Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) (near
      Barstow, CA; Canberra, Australia; and Madrid, Spain) comprise
      the DSN tracking network.  Each complex is equipped with
      several antennas [including at least one each 70-m, 34-m High
      Efficiency (HEF), and 34-m standard (STD)], associated
      electronics, and operational systems.  Primary activity at each
      complex is radiation of commands to and reception of telemetry
      data from active spacecraft.  Transmission and reception is
      possible in several radio-frequency bands, the most common
      being S-band (nominally a frequency of 2100-2300 MHz or a
      wavelength of 14.2-13.0 cm) and X-band (7100-8500 MHz or 4.2-
      3.5 cm).  Transmitter output powers of up to 400 kw are
      available.
 
      Ground stations have the ability to transmit coded and uncoded
      waveforms which can be echoed by distant spacecraft.  Analysis
      of the received coding allows navigators to determine the
      distance to the spacecraft; analysis of Doppler shift on the
      carrier signal allows estimation of the line-of-sight
      spacecraft velocity.  Range and Doppler measurements are used
      to calculate the spacecraft trajectory and to infer gravity
      fields of objects near the spacecraft.
 
      Ground stations can record spacecraft signals that have
      propagated through or been scattered from target media.
      Measurements of signal parameters after wave interactions with
      surfaces, atmospheres, rings, and plasmas are used to infer
      physical and electrical properties of the target.
 
      Principal investigators vary from experiment to experiment.
      See the corresponding section of the spacecraft instrument
      description or the data set description for specifics.
 
      The Deep Space Network is managed by the Jet Propulsion
      Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology for the
      U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

    Subsystems - DSN
    ================
      The Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) are an integral
      part of the Radio Science instrument, along with other
      receiving stations and the spacecraft Radio Frequency
      Subsystem.  Their system performance directly determines the
      degree of success of Radio Science investigations, and their
      system calibration determines the degree of accuracy in the
      results of the experiments.  The following paragraphs describe
      the functions performed by the individual subsystems of a DSCC.
      This material has been adapted from [ASMAR&amp;HERRERA1993]; for
      additional information, consult [DSN810-5].
 
      Each DSCC includes a set of antennas, a Signal Processing
      Center (SPC), and communication links to the Jet Propulsion
      Laboratory (JPL).  The general configuration is illustrated
      below; antennas (Deep Space Stations, or DSS -- a term carried
      over from earlier times when antennas were individually
      instrumented) are listed in the table.

      DSCC Monitor and Control Subsystem
      ----------------------------------
        The DSCC Monitor and Control Subsystem (DMC) is part of the
        Monitor and Control System (MON) which also includes the
        ground communications Central Communications Terminal and the
        Network Operations Control Center (NOCC) Monitor and Control
        Subsystem.  The DMC is the center of activity at a DSCC.  The
        DMC receives and archives most of the information from the
        NOCC needed by the various DSCC subsystems during their
        operation.  Control of most of the DSCC subsystems, as well
        as the handling and displaying of any responses to control
        directives and configuration and status information received
        from each of the subsystems, is done through the DMC.  The
        effect of this is to centralize the control, display, and
        archiving functions necessary to operate a DSCC.
        Communication between the various subsystems is done using a
        Local Area Network (LAN) hooked up to each subsystem via a
        network interface unit (NIU).
 
        DMC operations are divided into two separate areas: the
        Complex Monitor and Control (CMC) and the Link Monitor and
        Control (LMC).  The primary purpose of the CMC processor for
        Radio Science support is to receive and store all predict
        sets transmitted from NOCC such as Radio Science, antenna
        pointing, tracking, receiver, and uplink predict sets and
        then, at a later time, to distribute them to the appropriate
        subsystems via the LAN.  Those predict sets can be stored in
        the CMC for a maximum of three days under normal conditions.
        The CMC also receives, processes, and displays event/alarm
        messages; maintains an operator log; and produces tape labels
        for the DSP.  Assignment and configuration of the LMCs is
        done through the CMC; to a limited degree the CMC can perform
        some of the functions performed by the LMC.  There are two
        CMCs (one on-line and one backup) and three LMCs at each DSCC
        The backup CMC can function as an additional LMC if
        necessary.
 
        The LMC processor provides the operator interface for monitor
        and control of a link -- a group of equipment required to
        support a spacecraft pass.  For Radio Science, a link might
        include the DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP) (which,
        in turn, can control the SSI), or the Tracking Subsystem.
        The LMC also maintains an operator log which includes
        operator directives and subsystem responses.  One important
        Radio Science specific function that the LMC performs is
        receipt and transmission of the system temperature and signal
        level data from the PPM for display at the LMC console and
        for inclusion in Monitor blocks.  These blocks are recorded
        on magnetic tape as well as appearing in the Mission Control
        and Computing Center (MCCC) displays.  The LMC is required to
        operate without interruption for the duration of the Radio
        Science data acquisition period.
 
        The Area Routing Assembly (ARA), which is part of the Digital
        Communications Subsystem, controls all data communication
        between the stations and JPL.  The ARA receives all required
        data and status messages from the LMC/CMC and can record them
        to tape as well as transmit them to JPL via data lines.  The
        ARA also receives predicts and other data from JPL and passes
        them on to the CMC.
 
 
      DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem
      ---------------------------------
        Multi-mission Radio Science activities require support from
        the 70-m, 34-m HEF, and 34-m STD antenna subnets.  The
        antennas at each DSCC function as large-aperture collectors
        which, by double reflection, cause the incoming radio
        frequency (RF) energy to enter the feed horns.  The large
        collecting surface of the antenna focuses the incoming energy
        onto a subreflector, which is adjustable in both axial and
        angular position.  These adjustments are made to correct for
        gravitational deformation of the antenna as it moves between
        zenith and the horizon; the deformation can be as large as
        5 cm.  The subreflector adjustments optimize the channeling
        of energy from the primary reflector to the subreflector
        and then to the feed horns.  The 70-m and 34-m HEF antennas
        have &apos;shaped&apos; primary and secondary reflectors, with forms
        that are modified paraboloids.  This customization allows
        more uniform illumination of one reflector by another.  The
        34-m STD primary reflectors are classical paraboloids, while
        the subreflectors are standard hyperboloids.
 
        On the 70-m and 34-m STD antennas, the subreflector directs
        received energy from the antenna onto a dichroic plate, a
        device which reflects S-band energy to the S-band feed horn
        and passes X-band energy through to the X-band feed horn.  In
        the 34-m HEF, there is one &apos;common aperture feed,&apos; which
        accepts both frequencies without requiring a dichroic plate.
        RF energy to be transmitted into space by the horns is
        focused by the reflectors into narrow cylindrical beams,
        pointed with high precision (either to the dichroic plate or
        directly to the subreflector) by a series of drive motors and
        gear trains that can rotate the movable components and their
        support structures.
 
        The different antennas can be pointed by several means.  Two
        pointing modes commonly used during tracking passes are
        CONSCAN and &apos;blind pointing.&apos; With CONSCAN enabled and a
        closed loop receiver locked to a spacecraft signal, the
        system tracks the radio source by conically scanning around
        its position in the sky.  Pointing angle adjustments are
        computed from signal strength information (feedback) supplied
        by the receiver.  In this mode the Antenna Pointing Assembly
        (APA) generates a circular scan pattern which is sent to the
        Antenna Control System (ACS).  The ACS adds the scan pattern
        to the corrected pointing angle predicts.  Software in the
        receiver-exciter controller computes the received signal
        level and sends it to the APA.  The correlation of scan
        position with the received signal level variations allows the
        APA to compute offset changes which are sent to the ACS.
        Thus, within the capability of the closed-loop control
        system, the scan center is pointed precisely at the apparent
        direction of the spacecraft signal source.  An additional
        function of the APA is to provide antenna position angles and
        residuals, antenna control mode/status information, and
        predict-correction parameters to the Area Routing Assembly
        (ARA) via the LAN, which then sends this information to JPL
        via the Ground Communications Facility (GCF) for antenna
        status monitoring.
 
        During periods when excessive signal level dynamics or low
        received signal levels are expected (e.g., during an
        occultation experiment), CONSCAN should not be used.  Under
        these conditions, blind pointing (CONSCAN OFF) is used, and
        pointing angle adjustments are based on a predetermined
        Systematic Error Correction (SEC) model.
 
        Independent of CONSCAN state, subreflector motion in at least
        the z-axis may introduce phase variations into the received
        Radio Science data.  For that reason, during certain
        experiments, the subreflector in the 70-m and 34-m HEFs may
        be frozen in the z-axis at a position (often based on
        elevation angle) selected to minimize phase change and signal
        degradation.  This can be done via Operator Control Inputs
        (OCIs) from the LMC to the Subreflector Controller (SRC)
        which resides in the alidade room of the antennas.  The SRC
        passes the commands to motors that drive the subreflector to
        the desired position.  Unlike the 70-m and 34-m HEFs which
        have azimuth-elevation (AZ-EL) drives, the 34-m STD antennas
        use (hour angle-declination) HA-DEC drives.  The same
        positioning of the subreflector on the 34-m STD does not
        create the same effect as on the 70-m and 34-m HEFs.
 
        Pointing angles for all three antenna types are computed by
        the NOCC Support System (NSS) from an ephemeris provided by
        the flight project.  These predicts are received and archived
        by the CMC.  Before each track, they are transferred to the
        APA, which transforms the direction cosines of the predicts
        into AZ-EL coordinates for the 70-m and 34-m HEFs or into
        HA-DEC coordinates for the 34-m STD antennas.  The LMC
        operator then downloads the antenna AZ-EL or HA-DEC predict
        points to the antenna-mounted ACS computer along with a
        selected SEC model.  The pointing predicts consist of
        time-tagged AZ-EL or HA-DEC points at selected time intervals
        along with polynomial coefficients for interpolation between
        points.
 
        The ACS automatically interpolates the predict points,
        corrects the pointing predicts for refraction and
        subreflector position, and adds the proper systematic error
        correction and any manually entered antenna offsets.  The ACS
        then sends angular position commands for each axis at the
        rate of one per second.  In the 70-m and 34-m HEF, rate
        commands are generated from the position commands at the
        servo controller and are subsequently used to steer the
        antenna.  In the 34-m STD antennas motors, rather than
        servos, are used to steer the antenna; there is no feedback
        once the 34-m STD has been told where to point.
 
        When not using binary predicts (the routine mode for
        spacecraft tracking), the antennas can be pointed using
        &apos;planetary mode&apos; -- a simpler mode which uses right ascension
        (RA) and declination (DEC) values.  These change very slowly
        with respect to the celestial frame.  Values are provided to
        the station in text form for manual entry.  The ACS
        quadratically interpolates among three RA and DEC points
        which are on one-day centers.
 
        A third pointing mode -- sidereal -- is available for
        tracking radio sources fixed with respect to the celestial
        frame.
 
        Regardless of the pointing mode being used, a 70-m antenna
        has a special high-accuracy pointing capability called
        &apos;precision&apos; mode.  A pointing control loop derives the
        main AZ-EL pointing servo drive error signals from a two-
        axis autocollimator mounted on the Intermediate Reference
        Structure.  The autocollimator projects a light beam to a
        precision mirror mounted on the Master Equatorial drive
        system, a much smaller structure, independent of the main
        antenna, which is exactly positioned in HA and DEC with shaft
        encoders.  The autocollimator detects elevation/cross-
        elevation errors between the two reference surfaces by
        measuring the angular displacement of the reflected light
        beam.  This error is compensated for in the antenna servo by
        moving the antenna in the appropriate AZ-EL direction.
        Pointing accuracies of 0.004 degrees (15 arc seconds) are
        possible in &apos;precision&apos; mode.  The &apos;precision&apos; mode is not
        available on 34-m antennas -- nor is it needed, since their
        beamwidths are twice as large as on the 70-m antennas.
 
 
      DSCC Antenna Microwave Subsystem
      --------------------------------
        70-m Antennas: Each 70-m antenna has three feed cones
        installed in a structure at the center of the main reflector.
        The feeds are positioned 120 degrees apart on a circle.
        Selection of the feed is made by rotation of the
        subreflector.  A dichroic mirror assembly, half on the S-band
        cone and half on the X-band cone, permits simultaneous use of
        the S- and X-band frequencies.  The third cone is devoted to
        R&amp;D and more specialized work.
 
        The Antenna Microwave Subsystem (AMS) accepts the received S-
        and X-band signals at the feed horn and transmits them
        through polarizer plates to an orthomode transducer.  The
        polarizer plates are adjusted so that the signals are
        directed to a pair of redundant amplifiers for each
        frequency, thus allowing simultaneous reception of signals in
        two orthogonal polarizations.  For S-band these are two Block
        IVA S-band Traveling Wave Masers (TWMs); for X-band the
        amplifiers are Block IIA TWMs.
 
        34-m STD Antennas: These antennas have two feed horns, one
        for S-band signals and one for X-band.  The horns are mounted
        on a cone which is fixed in relation to the subreflector.  A
        dichroic plate mounted above the horns directs energy from
        the subreflector into the proper horn.
 
        The AMS directs the received S- and X-band signals through
        polarizer plates and on to amplification.  There are two
        Block III S-band TWMs and two Block I X-band TWMs.
 
        34-m HEF Antennas: Unlike the other antennas, the 34-m HEF
        uses a single feed for both S- and X-band.  Simultaneous S-
        and X-band receive as well as X-band transmit is possible
        thanks to the presence of an S/X &apos;combiner&apos; which acts as a
        diplexer.  For S-band, RCP or LCP is user selected through a
        switch so neither a polarizer nor an orthomode transducer is
        needed.  X-band amplification options include two Block II
        TWMs or an HEMT Low Noise Amplifier (LNA).  S-band
        amplification is provided by an FET LNA.
 
 
      DSCC Receiver-Exciter Subsystem
      -------------------------------
        The Receiver-Exciter Subsystem is composed of three groups of
        equipment: the closed-loop receiver group, the open-loop
        receiver group, and the RF monitor group.  This subsystem is
        controlled by the Receiver-Exciter Controller (REC) which
        communicates directly with the DMC for predicts and OCI
        reception and status reporting.
 
        The exciter generates the S-band signal (or X-band for the
        34-m HEF only) which is provided to the Transmitter Subsystem
        for the spacecraft uplink signal.  It is tunable under
        command of the Digitally Controlled Oscillator (DCO) which
        receives predicts from the Metric Data Assembly (MDA).
 
        The diplexer in the signal path between the transmitter and
        the feed horn for all three antennas (used for simultaneous
        transmission and reception) may be configured such that it is
        out of the received signal path (in listen-only or bypass
        mode) in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the
        receiver system.
 
        Closed Loop Receivers: The Block IV receiver-exciter at the
        70-m stations allows for two receiver channels, each capable
        of L-Band (e.g., 1668 MHz frequency or 18 cm wavelength),
        S-band, or X-band reception, and an S-band exciter for
        generation of uplink signals through the low-power or
        high-power transmitter.  The Block III receiver-exciter at
        the 34-m STD stations allows for two receiver channels, each
        capable of S-band or X-band reception and an exciter used to
        generate an uplink signal through the low-power transmitter.
        The receiver-exciter at the 34-m HEF stations allows for one
        channel only.
 
        The closed-loop receivers provide the capability for rapid
        acquisition of a spacecraft signal and telemetry lockup.  In
        order to accomplish acquisition within a short time, the
        receivers are predict driven to search for, acquire, and
        track the downlink automatically.  Rapid acquisition
        precludes manual tuning though that remains as a backup
        capability.  The subsystem utilizes FFT analyzers for rapid
        acquisition.  The predicts are NSS generated, transmitted to
        the CMC which sends them to the Receiver-Exciter Subsystem
        where two sets can be stored.  The receiver starts
        acquisition at uplink time plus one round-trip-light-time or
        at operator specified times.  The receivers may also be
        operated from the LMC without a local operator attending
        them.  The receivers send performance and status data,
        displays, and event messages to the LMC.
 
        Either the exciter synthesizer signal or the simulation
        (SIM) synthesizer signal is used as the reference for the
        Doppler extractor in the closed-loop receiver systems,
        depending on the spacecraft being tracked (and Project
        guidelines).  The SIM synthesizer is not ramped; instead it
        uses one constant frequency, the Track Synthesizer Frequency
        (TSF), which is an average frequency for the entire pass.
 
        The closed-loop receiver AGC loop can be configured to one of
        three settings: narrow, medium, or wide.  It will be
        configured such that the expected amplitude changes are
        accommodated with minimum distortion.  The loop bandwidth
        (2BLo) will be configured such that the expected phase
        changes can be accommodated while maintaining the best
        possible loop SNR.
 
        Open-Loop Receivers: The Radio Science Open-Loop Receiver
        (OLR) is a dedicated four channel, narrow-band receiver which
        provides amplified and downconverted video band signals to
        the DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP).
 
        The OLR utilizes a fixed first Local Oscillator (LO)
        frequency and a tunable second LO frequency to minimize phase
        noise and improve frequency stability.  The OLR consists of
        an RF-to-IF downconverter located in the antenna, an IF
        selection switch (IVC), and a Radio Science IF-VF
        downconverter (RIV) located in the SPC.  The RF-IF
        downconverters in the 70-m antennas are equipped for four IF
        channels: S-RCP, S-LCP, X-RCP, and X-LCP.  The 34-m HEF
        stations are equipped with a two-channel RF-IF: S-band and
        X-band.  The IVC switches the IF input between the 70-m and
        34-m HEF antennas.
 
        The RIV contains the tunable second LO, a set of video
        bandpass filters, IF attenuators, and a controller (RIC).
        The LO tuning is done via DSP control of the POCA/PLO
        combination based on a predict set.  The POCA is a
        Programmable Oscillator Control Assembly and the PLO is a
        Programmable Local Oscillator (commonly called the DANA
        synthesizer).  The bandpass filters are selectable via the
        DSP.  The RIC provides an interface between the DSP and the
        RIV.  It is controlled from the LMC via the DSP.  The RIC
        selects the filter and attenuator settings and provides
        monitor data to the DSP.  The RIC could also be manually
        controlled from the front panel in case the electronic
        interface to the DSP is lost.
 
        RF Monitor -- SSI and PPM: The RF monitor group of the
        Receiver-Exciter Subsystem provides spectral measurements
        using the Spectral Signal Indicator (SSI) and measurements of
        the received channel system temperature and spacecraft signal
        level using the Precision Power Monitor (PPM).
 
        The SSI provides a local display of the received signal
        spectrum at a dedicated terminal at the DSCC and routes these
        same data to the DSP which routes them to NOCC for remote
        display at JPL for real-time monitoring and RIV/DSP
        configuration verification.  These displays are used to
        validate Radio Science Subsystem data at the DSS, NOCC, and
        Mission Support Areas.  The SSI configuration is controlled
        by the DSP and a duplicate of the SSI spectrum appears on the
        LMC via the DSP.  During real-time operations the SSI data
        also serve as a quick-look science data type for Radio
        Science experiments.
 
        The PPM measures system noise temperatures (SNT) using a
        Noise Adding Radiometer (NAR) and downlink signal levels
        using the Signal Level Estimator (SLE).  The PPM accepts its
        input from the closed-loop receiver.  The SNT is measured by
        injecting known amounts of noise power into the signal path
        and comparing the total power with the noise injection &apos;on&apos;
        against the total power with the noise injection &apos;off.&apos; That
        operation is based on the fact that receiver noise power is
        directly proportional to temperature; thus measuring the
        relative increase in noise power due to the presence of a
        calibrated thermal noise source allows direct calculation of
        SNT.  Signal level is measured by calculating an FFT to
        estimate the SNR between the signal level and the receiver
        noise floor where the power is known from the SNT
        measurements.
 
        There is one PPM controller at the SPC which is used to
        control all SNT measurements.  The SNT integration time can
        be selected to represent the time required for a measurement
        of 30K to have a one-sigma uncertainty of 0.3K or 1%.
 
 
      DSCC Transmitter Subsystem
      --------------------------
        The Transmitter Subsystem accepts the S-band frequency
        exciter signal from the Block III or Block IV Receiver-
        Exciter Subsystem exciter and amplifies it to the required
        transmit output level.  The amplified signal is routed via
        the diplexer through the feed horn to the antenna and then
        focused and beamed to the spacecraft.
 
        The Transmitter Subsystem power capabilities range from 18 kw
        to 400 kw.  Power levels above 18 kw are available only at
        70-m stations.
 
 
      DSCC Tracking Subsystem
      -----------------------
        The Tracking Subsystem primary functions are to acquire and
        maintain communications with the spacecraft and to generate
        and format radiometric data containing Doppler and range.
 
        The DSCC Tracking Subsystem (DTK) receives the carrier
        signals and ranging spectra from the Receiver-Exciter
        Subsystem.  The Doppler cycle counts are counted, formatted,
        and transmitted to JPL in real time.  Ranging data are also
        transmitted to JPL in real time.  Also contained in these
        blocks is the AGC information from the Receiver-Exciter
        Subsystem.  The Radio Metric Data Conditioning Team (RMDCT)
        at JPL produces an Archival Tracking Data File (ATDF) tape
        which contains Doppler and ranging data.
 
        In addition, the Tracking Subsystem receives from the CMC
        frequency predicts (used to compute frequency residuals and
        noise estimates), receiver tuning predicts (used to tune the
        closed-loop receivers), and uplink tuning predicts (used to
        tune the exciter).  From the LMC, it receives configuration
        and control directives as well as configuration and status
        information on the transmitter, microwave, and frequency and
        timing subsystems.
 
        The Metric Data Assembly (MDA) controls all of the DTK
        functions supporting the uplink and downlink activities.  The
        MDA receives uplink predicts and controls the uplink tuning
        by commanding the DCO.  The MDA also controls the Sequential
        Ranging Assembly (SRA).  It formats the Doppler and range
        measurements and provides them to the GCF for transmission to
        NOCC.
 
        The Sequential Ranging Assembly (SRA) measures the round trip
        light time (RTLT) of a radio signal traveling from a ground
        tracking station to a spacecraft and back.  From the RTLT,
        phase, and Doppler data, the spacecraft range can be
        determined.  A coded signal is modulated on an uplink carrier
        and transmitted to the spacecraft where it is detected and
        transponded back to the ground station.  As a result, the
        signal received at the tracking station is delayed by its
        round trip through space and shifted in frequency by the
        Doppler effect due to the relative motion between the
        spacecraft and the tracking station on Earth.
 
 
      DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP)
      ----------------------------------------
        The DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP) located at the
        SPC digitizes and records on magnetic tapes the narrowband
        output data from the RIV.  It consists of a Narrow Band
        Occultation Converter (NBOC) containing four Analog-to-
        Digital Converters (ADCs), a ModComp CLASSIC computer
        processor called the Spectrum Processing Assembly (SPA), and
        two to six magnetic tape drives.  Magnetic tapes are known as
        Original Data Records (ODRs).  Electronic near real-time
        transmission of data to JPL (an Original Data Stream, or ODS)
        may be possible in certain circumstances;
 
        The DSP is operated through the LMC.  Using the SPA-R
        software, the DSP allows for real-time frequency and time
        offsets (while in RUN mode) and, if necessary, snap tuning
        between the two frequency ranges transmitted by the
        spacecraft: coherent and non-coherent.  The DSP receives
        Radio Science frequency predicts from the CMC, allows for
        multiple predict set archiving (up to 60 sets) at the SPA,
        and allows for manual predict generation and editing.  It
        accepts configuration and control data from the LMC, provides
        display data to the LMC, and transmits the signal spectra
        from the SSI as well as status information to NOCC and the
        Project Mission Support Area (MSA) via the GCF data lines.
        The DSP records the digitized narrowband samples and the
        supporting header information (i.e., time tags, POCA
        frequencies, etc.) on 9-track magnetic tapes in 6250 or 1600
        bpi GCR format.
 
        Through the DSP-RIC interface the DSP controls the RIV filter
        selection and attenuation levels.  It also receives RIV
        performance monitoring via the RIC.  In case of failure of
        the DSP-RIC interface, the RIV can be controlled manually
        from the front panel.
 
        All the RIV and DSP control parameters and configuration
        directives are stored in the SPA in a macro-like file called
        an &apos;experiment directive&apos; table.  A number of default
        directives exist in the DSP for the major Radio Science
        experiments.  Operators can create their own table entries.
 
        Items such as verification of the configuration of the prime
        open-loop recording subsystem, the selection of the required
        predict sets, and proper system performance prior to the
        recording periods will be checked in real-time at JPL via the
        NOCC displays using primarily the remote SSI display at NOCC
        and the NRV displays.  Because of this, transmission of the
        DSP/SSI monitor information is enabled prior to the start of
        recording.  The specific run time and tape recording times
        will be identified in the Sequence of Events (SOE) and/or DSN
        Keyword File.
 
        The DSP can be used to duplicate ODRs.  It also has the
        capability to play back a certain section of the recorded
        data after conclusion of the recording periods.
 
 
      DSCC Frequency and Timing Subsystem
      -----------------------------------
        The Frequency and Timing Subsystem (FTS) provides all
        frequency and timing references required by the other DSCC
        subsystems.  It contains four frequency standards of which
        one is prime and the other three are backups.  Selection of
        the prime standard is done via the CMC.  Of these four
        standards, two are hydrogen masers followed by clean-up loops
        (CUL) and two are cesium standards.  These four standards all
        feed the Coherent Reference Generator (CRG) which provides
        the frequency references used by the rest of the complex.  It
        also provides the frequency reference to the Master Clock
        Assembly (MCA) which in turn provides time to the Time
        Insertion and Distribution Assembly (TID) which provides UTC
        and SIM-time to the complex.
 
        JPL&apos;s ability to monitor the FTS at each DSCC is limited to
        the MDA calculated Doppler pseudo-residuals, the Doppler
        noise, the SSI, and to a system which uses the Global
        Positioning System (GPS).  GPS receivers at each DSCC receive
        a one-pulse-per-second pulse from the station&apos;s (hydrogen
        maser referenced) FTS and a pulse from a GPS satellite at
        scheduled times.  After compensating for the satellite signal
        delay, the timing offset is reported to JPL where a database
        is kept.  The clock offsets stored in the JPL database are
        given in microseconds; each entry is a mean reading of
        measurements from several GPS satellites and a time tag
        associated with the mean reading.  The clock offsets provided
        include those of SPC 10 relative to UTC (NIST), SPC 40
        relative to SPC 10, etc.
 
 
    Optics - DSN
    ============
      Performance of DSN ground stations depends primarily on size of
      the antenna and capabilities of electronics.  These are
      summarized in the following set of tables.  Note that 64-m
      antennas were upgraded to 70-m between 1986 and 1989.
      Beamwidth is half-power full angular width.  Polarization is
      circular; L denotes left circular polarization (LCP), and R
      denotes right circular polarization (RCP).

    =================
 
      DSCC Open-Loop Receiver
      -----------------------
        The open loop receiver block diagram shown below is for 70-m
        antenna sites as used for Clementine observations.  This
        was a non-standard configuration required to capture the
        Clementine signal, which was about 22 MHz below normal
        NASA transmitter frequencies [DEVEREAUX1994].
 
        The 2273 MHz Clementine S-band signals are first downconverted
        to approximately 273 MHz.  Then a second mixer upconverts
        the signals to 318 MHz, where they can be fed into the
        normal X-band receiver chain.  Conversion loss through
        the added mixer is about 6 dB.  Based on a tuning
        prediction file, the POCA controls the DANA synthesizer
        the output of which (after multiplication) mixes the
        input signals at 318 MHz to fixed intermediate frequencies
        for subsequent amplification.  These signals in turn are
        down converted and passed through additional filters until
        they yield baseband output of up to 25 kHz in width.  The
        baseband output is digitally sampled by the DSP and either
        written to magnetic tape or electronically transferred for
        further analysis.

    Calibration - DSN
    =================
      Calibrations of hardware systems are carried out periodically
      by DSN personnel; these ensure that systems operate at required
      performance levels -- for example, that antenna patterns,
      receiver gain, propagation delays, and Doppler uncertainties
      meet specifications.  No information on specific calibration
      activities is available.  Nominal performance specifications
      are shown in the tables above.  Additional information may be
      available in [DSN810-5].
 
      Prior to each tracking pass, station operators perform a series
      of calibrations to ensure that systems meet specifications for
      that operational period.  Included in these calibrations is
      measurement of receiver system temperature in the configuration
      to be employed during the pass.  Results of these calibrations
      are recorded in (hard copy) Controller&apos;s Logs for each pass.
 
      The nominal procedure for initializing open-loop receiver
      attenuator settings is described below.  In cases where widely
      varying signal levels are expected, the procedure may be
      modified in advance or real-time adjustments may be made to
      attenuator settings.
 
 
      Open-Loop Receiver Attenuation Calibration
      ------------------------------------------
        The open-loop receiver attenuator calibrations are performed
        to establish the output of the open-loop receivers at a level
        that will not saturate the analog-to-digital converters.  To
        achieve this, the calibration is done using a test signal
        generated by the exciter/translator that is set to the peak
        predicted signal level for the upcoming pass.  Then the
        output level of the receiver&apos;s video band spectrum envelope
        is adjusted to the level determined by equation (3) below (to
        five-sigma).  Note that the SNR in the equation (2) is in dB
        while the SNR in equation (3) is linear.
 
      Pn = -198.6 + 10*log(SNT) + 10*log(1.2*Fbw)              (1)
 
      SNR = Ps - Pn                               (SNR in dB)  (2)
 
      Vrms = sqrt(SNR + 1)/[1 + 0.283*sqrt(SNR)]  (SNR linear) (3)
 
      where    Fbw = receiver filter bandwidth (Hz)
               Pn  = receiver noise power (dBm)
               Ps  = signal power (dBm)
               SNT = system noise temperature (K)
               SNR = predicted signal-to-noise ratio
 
 
    Operational Considerations - DSN
    ================================
      The DSN is a complex and dynamic &apos;instrument.&apos; Its performance
      for Radio Science depends on a number of factors from equipment
      configuration to meteorological conditions.  No specific
      information on &apos;operational considerations&apos; can be given here.
 
 
    Operational Modes - DSN
    =======================
 
      DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem
      ---------------------------------
        Pointing of DSCC antennas may be carried out in several ways.
        For details see the subsection &apos;DSCC Antenna Mechanical
        Subsystem&apos; in the &apos;Subsystem&apos; section.  Binary pointing is
        the preferred mode for tracking spacecraft; pointing
        predicts are provided, and the antenna simply follows those.
        With CONSCAN, the antenna scans conically about the optimum
        pointing direction, using closed-loop receiver signal
        strength estimates as feedback.  In planetary mode, the
        system interpolates from three (slowly changing) RA-DEC
        target coordinates; this is &apos;blind&apos; pointing since there is
        no feedback from a detected signal.  In sidereal mode, the
        antenna tracks a fixed point on the celestial sphere.  In
        &apos;precision&apos; mode, the antenna pointing is adjusted using an
        optical feedback system.  It is possible on most antennas to
        freeze z-axis motion of the subreflector to minimize phase
        changes in the received signal.
 
 
      DSCC Receiver-Exciter Subsystem
      -------------------------------
        The diplexer in the signal path between the transmitter and
        the feed horns on all three antennas may be configured so
        that it is out of the received signal path in order to
        improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the receiver system.
        This is known as the &apos;listen-only&apos; or &apos;bypass&apos; mode.
 
 
      Closed-Loop vs. Open-Loop Reception
      -----------------------------------
        Radio Science data can be collected in two modes: closed-
        loop, in which a phase-locked loop receiver tracks the
        spacecraft signal, or open-loop, in which a receiver samples
        and records a band within which the desired signal presumably
        resides.  Closed-loop data are collected using Closed-Loop
        Receivers, and open-loop data are collected using Open-Loop
        Receivers in conjunction with the DSCC Spectrum Processing
        Subsystem (DSP).  See the Subsystems section for further
        information.
 
 
      Closed-Loop Receiver AGC Loop
      -----------------------------
        The closed-loop receiver AGC loop can be configured to one of
        three settings: narrow, medium, or wide.  Ordinarily it is
        configured so that expected signal amplitude changes are
        accommodated with minimum distortion.  The loop bandwidth is
        ordinarily configured so that expected phase changes can be
        accommodated while maintaining the best possible loop SNR.
 
 
      Coherent vs. Non-Coherent Operation
      -----------------------------------
        The frequency of the signal transmitted from the spacecraft
        can generally be controlled in two ways -- by locking to a
        signal received from a ground station or by locking to an
        on-board oscillator.  These are known as the coherent (or
        &apos;two-way&apos;) and non-coherent (&apos;one-way&apos;) modes, respectively.
        Mode selection is made at the spacecraft, based on commands
        received from the ground.  When operating in the coherent
        mode, the transponder carrier frequency is derived from the
        received uplink carrier frequency with a &apos;turn-around ratio&apos;
        typically of 240/221.  In the non-coherent mode, the
        downlink carrier frequency is derived from the spacecraft
        on-board crystal-controlled oscillator.  Either closed-loop
        or open-loop receivers (or both) can be used with either
        spacecraft frequency reference mode.  Closed-loop reception
        in two-way mode is usually preferred for routine tracking.
        Occasionally the spacecraft operates coherently while two
        ground stations receive the &apos;downlink&apos; signal; this is
        sometimes known as the &apos;three-way&apos; mode.
 
 
      DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP)
      ----------------------------------------
        The DSP can operate in four sampling modes with from 1 to 4
        input signals.  Input channels are assigned to ADC inputs
        during DSP configuration.  Modes and sampling rates are
        summarized in the tables below:

    Measurement Parameters - DSN
    ============================
 
      Open-Loop System
      ----------------
        Output from the Open-Loop Receivers (OLRs), as sampled and
        recorded by the DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP), is
        a stream of 8- or 12-bit quantized voltage samples.  The
        nominal input to the Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) is
        +/-10 volts, but the precise scaling between input voltages
        and output digitized samples is usually irrelevant for
        analysis; the digital data are generally referenced to a
        known noise or signal level within the data stream itself --
        for example, the thermal noise output of the radio receivers
        which has a known system noise temperature (SNT).  Raw
        samples comprise the data block in each DSP record; a header
        record (presently 83 16-bit words) contains ancillary
        information such as:
 
         time tag for the first sample in the data block
         RMS values of receiver signal levels and ADC outputs
         POCA frequency and drift rate
 
 
      Closed-Loop System
      ------------------
        Closed-loop data are recorded in Archival Tracking Data Files
        (ATDFs), as well as certain secondary products such as the
        Orbit Data File (ODF).  The ATDF Tracking Logical Record
        contains 117 entries including status information and
        measurements of ranging, Doppler, and signal strength.
