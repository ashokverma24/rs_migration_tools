    Instrument Overview
    ===================
      Venus Express (VEX) Radio Science investigations utilized
      instrumentation with elements on both the spacecraft and ground
      (Earth).  Much of this was shared equipment, being used for routine
      telecommunications as well as for Radio Science.  Ground systems were
      provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) at New Norcia, Australia,
      and Cebreros, Spain.  Ground support was also provided by the U.S.
      National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Deep Space Network
      (DSN) at sites in Australia, Spain, and the United States.  Because the
      VEX orbit period was 24 hours and pericenter was synchronized with
      viewing from Australia, all radio science activities were conducted
      using the ESA facility at New Norcia and the DSN complex at Canberra.
      Performance and calibration of both the spacecraft and ground systems
      directly affected the radio science data accuracy and played a major
      role in determining the quality of the results.
 
      The spacecraft was able to receive and transmit signals at both S-band
      (approximately 13 cm wavelength) and X-band (approximately 3.5 cm).
      Two low-gain and two high-gain antennas were available; but not all
      combinations of antenna and band could be selected.  The spacecraft
      transmissions could use either an onboard oscillator for the frequency
      reference (&apos;one-way&apos; mode) or a signal transmitted from the ground
      (&apos;two-way&apos; mode).  In the former case, an ultra-stable oscillator (USO)
      could be selected; in the latter case, either an S- or X-band signal
      from the ground could be used as the reference, depending on the
      antenna selected.
 
      This description covers only the spacecraft and DSN components of the
      instrument and only those portions of the VEX Radio Science
      investigations supported by DSN data.  For more information see
      [HAEUSLERETAL2006] and [MATTEIETAL2007].
 
 
    Science Objectives
    ==================
      Two different types of radio science measurements were carried out with
      Venus Express:
 
        Radiometric Measurements:  Ground stations have the ability to
        transmit coded and uncoded waveforms which can be echoed by distant
        spacecraft.  Analysis of the received coding allows navigators to
        determine the distance to the spacecraft; analysis of Doppler shift
        on the carrier signal allows estimation of the line-of-sight
        spacecraft velocity.  Range and Doppler measurements are used to
        calculate the spacecraft trajectory and to infer gravity fields of
        objects near the spacecraft.  NB: Doppler measurements can be made in
        the one-way mode, but are usually more accurate if carried out in
        the two-way mode.
 
        Radio Propagation Measurements: Ground stations can record spacecraft
        signals that have propagated through or been scattered from target
        media.  Measurements of signal parameters after wave interactions
        with surfaces, atmospheres, rings, and plasmas are used to infer
        physical and electrical properties of the target.  Radio propagation
        measurements can be conducted in either one-way or two-way mode.
 
      These measurements were applied - separately and together - to Venus
      science objectives such as inference of local gravity field anomalies,
      atmospheric drag, temperature and pressure of the atmosphere, electron
      density in the ionosphere, scattering properties of the surface, and
      structure of the solar wind.
 
 
      Gravity Measurements
      --------------------
        Measurement of the gravity field provides significant constraints on
        inferences about the interior structure of Venus.  Precise, detailed
        study of the spacecraft motion in Venus orbit can yield the mass
        distribution of the planet.  Topographic data, such as those obtained
        by the MAGELLAN radar altimeter, form a critical adjunct to these
        measurements since only after the gravitational effects are adjusted
        for topography can the gravity anomalies be interpreted geophysically.
 
        Because of the thorough investigation of the Venus gravity field
        by MAGELLAN [KONOPLIVETAL1999], Venus Express studies focused on the
        characteristics of the field at 140-220 degrees east longitude and
        40-80 degrees north latitude, where gaps in the MAGELLAN tracking
        were most common.  The main area, known as Atalanta Plantia, is a low
        altitude basin of diameter of about 1500 km and depth of about 2 km.
        From its pericenter altitude of about 250 km, VEX was expected to
        provide improvements to the field in this area; those, in turn, would
        lead to better understanding of the lithosphere.
 
        A possible by-product of the gravity field analysis is information
        on the density structure of the upper atmosphere [TRACADISETAL2001].
        The first campaign designed to detect and measure drag was conducted
        during the summer of 2008.
 
 
      Radio Occultation Measurements
      ------------------------------
        Atmospheric measurements by the method of radio occultation
        contribute to an improved understanding of structure, circulation,
        dynamics, and transport in the atmosphere.  These results are
        based on detailed analysis of the radio signal phase as the ray path
        enters and exits occultation by the planet, leading to profiles of
        temperature and pressure in the neutral atmosphere and profiles of
        electron density in the ionosphere.  Once the refractivity profile
        of the neutral atmosphere has been determined, refractivity can be
        used to estimate defocusing loss and the remaining loss in signal
        intensity can be attributed  to absorption.  Venus radio occultation
        data have previously been collected and analyzed from Pioneer Venus
        Orbiter [KLIORE&amp;PATEL1982] [NEWMANETAL1984] [JENKINS&amp;STEFFES1991]
        and MAGELLAN [JENKINSETAL1994] [HINSON&amp;JENKINS1995].
 
        Retrieval of atmospheric profiles requires coherent samples (samples
        retaining both amplitude and frequency information) of the
        radio signal that has propagated through the atmosphere, plus accurate
        knowledge of the spacecraft trajectory.  The latter was obtained from
        the VEX Flight Dynamics Team.  Solutions from VEX occultation data
        provided neutral atmospheric structure from about 37 km altitude
        (limited by critical refraction) to about 100 km and electron density
        profiles from 100 to 400 km [PAETZOLDETAL2007B].
 
        Spatial and temporal coverage in radio occultation experiments
        are determined by the geometry of the spacecraft orbit and the dates
        and times at which occultation data are acquired.  Since VEX radio
        occultation experiments were conducted on a regular basis using a
        polar orbit, there was extensive occultation coverage at high northern
        and southern latitudes (e.g., beyond 60 degrees).  As the orbit
        appeared to drift from edge-on to nearly broadside (as viewed from
        Earth), occultation points moved toward the equator and the entry/exit
        angle approached grazing.  During the first 1000 orbits/days of VEX
        operations, there were six occultation &apos;seasons&apos; of typically 60-70
        orbits each interleaved with intervals of approximately the same
        duration when there were no occultations.
 
 
      Bistatic Surface Scattering Measurements
      ------------------------------------------
        One of the spacecraft&apos;s high-gain antennas (HGA1 or HGA2) could also
        be pointed toward the surface of the planet.  The strength of the
        signal scattered from the illuminated area could be measured and the
        results interpreted in terms of the dielectric constant of the
        surface material.  The model for interpretation assumes Fresnel
        reflection at the specular angle.  The cross-spectrum between the
        right- and left-circularly polarized echo channels (RCP and LCP,
        respectively) contains information about the argument of the
        dielectric constant -- that is, whether it is insulating or
        conducting.  A conducting material was inferred from MAGELLAN
        bistatic radar observations using linear polarization near
        Cleopatra Patera in Maxwell Montes [PETTENGILLETAL1996].  One goal
        of the VEX bistatic radar experiments was to confirm the MAGELLAN
        results using circular polarization and to investigate whether
        similar signatures could be found at other high-altitude targets.
 
        Under certain circumstances, dispersion of the echo (its spectral
        broadening) may be interpreted in terms of the rms surface roughness
        on scales comparable to the wavelength.
 
 
      Solar Scintillation and Faraday Rotation Experiments
      ----------------------------------------------------
        Solar scintillation observations were conducted to improve
        understanding of the structure and dynamics of the solar
        corona and wind.  Because Venus orbits the Sun, spacecraft like VEX
        are transported behind the solar disk, as seen from Earth.  Radio
        waves propagating between VEX and Earth are refracted and scattered
        by the solar plasma [WOO1993].  Intensity fluctuations
        can be related to fluctuations in electron density along the path,
        while Doppler or phase scintillations can be related to both electron
        density fluctuations and also the speed of the solar wind.  Many
        plasma effects decrease as the square of the radio frequency;
        scintillations are about an order of magnitude stronger at S-band
        than X-band.  The first solar conjunction observations with VEX were
        conducted during late 2006.

    Instrument Specification - Spacecraft
    =====================================
      The Venus Express spacecraft telecommunications subsystem served as
      part of a radio science subsystem for investigations of Venus.  It,
      like the spacecraft itself, was modeled on the radio system used on
      Mars Express. Many details of the subsystem are unknown; but they are
      not important for understanding the science.  The spacecraft &apos;build
      date&apos; is taken to be 2005-11-01, shortly before launch.

        The Venus Express radio subsystem comprised several components (shown
        in the simplified diagram above), configured to provide redundant
        functions should any single component fail.
 
        The primary high-gain antenna (HGA1) was a body-fixed 1.30 m diameter
        parabolic dish which allowed transmission and reception at both S- and
        X-band.  The HGA1 boresight was in the +X direction of the spacecraft
        coordinate system, offset 5 degrees in the +Z direction.  Its gain was
        25.7 dBi and 37 dBi at S- and X-band, respectively.
 
        The auxilliary high-gain antenna (HGA2) was mounted oppositely to HGA1
        so that it could be used for communication with Earth when Venus was
        between the quadrature points of its orbit and HGA1 was being used as
        a Sun shield.  HGA2 could only be used for communication at X-Band;
        its diameter was 0.2 m and its X-band gain was 25 dB.
 
        Two low-gain antennas (LGA1 and LGA2) were mounted on the top and
        bottom panels of the spacecraft; they operated only at S-band.  The
        boresight for LGA1 was nominally in the +Z direction; the boresight
        of LGA2 was offset from the -Z spacecraft axis by 17.5 degrees in
        the +X direction.  Both LGAs had very broad antenna patterns.
 
        HGA1 was the primary antenna for receiving telecommands from and
        transmitting telemetry signals to the ground when VEX was on the far
        side of the Sun.  In that geometry HGA1 also provided thermal
        protection to the spacecraft.  When Venus was between its quadrature
        points -- on the near side of the Sun -- HGA2 was the prime antenna
        and HGA1 served solely as a sun shield. The LGAs were used during the
        commissioning phase after launch and for emergency operations.
 
        The Radio Frequency Distribution Unit (RFDU) switched S-Band signals
        and the Waveguide Interface Unit (WIU) switched X-Band signals on the
        spacecraft.
 
        Switchable Traveling Wave Tube Amplifiers (TWTA1 and TWTA2) provided
        65 watts of X-band transmitter power to the RFDU; their inputs could
        come from either Transponder 1 or Transponder 2.  The S-band
        transmitter power was 5 watts, which was generated within the
        transponder units.
 
        The S-band uplink was received via LGA1, LGA2, or HGA1.  In the
        coherent two-way mode the received frequency was used to derive the
        downlink frequencies by using the constant transponder ratios
        880/221 and 240/221 for X-band and S-band downlink, respectively.
 
        The X-band uplink was received via either HGA.  In the coherent
        two-way mode the received frequency was used to derive the downlink
        frequencies by using the constant transponder ratios 880/749 and
        240/749 for X-band and S-band downlink, respectively.  An X-band
        uplink generally enhanced the performance of the radio link
        because X-band is less sensitive to the interplanetary plasma
        along the propagation path.
 
        The X-band and S-band frequencies were related by a factor of 11/3.
        If an uplink existed and the &apos;one-way&apos; mode had not been selected,
        the downlinks were coherent with the uplink by their respective
        transponding ratios.  The dual-frequency downlink allowed separation
        of the classical Doppler shift, due to relative motion of the
        spacecraft and the ground station, from the dispersive media effects,
        due to the propagation of the radio waves through the ionosphere and
        interplanetary medium.
 
        In one-way mode, the downlink transponder 1 frequency was derived
        from a Temperature Controlled Crystal Oscillator (TCXO) and the
        transponder 2 frequency was derived from an onboard ultrastable
        oscillator (USO).  The one-way mode could be selected by command
        from the ground.  If the spacecraft receiver could not detect an
        uplink signal from the ground, the TCXO or USO was selected by
        default.
 
        TCXO stability was several orders of magnitude less than the
        uplink reference; the USO stability was 1 part in 10^13 over time
        scales of 10-100 seconds; this was an order of magnitude less
        stable than frequency references on the gorund.  However, for
        long-duration, deep radio occultations, the USO was preferred
        because perturbations on the downlink signals could be attributed
        unambiguously to a single passage through the atmosphere.
        Although either USO or TCXO could have served for bistatic radar,
        the USO was preferred for its better performance.  For other
        observations, the two-way coherent mode was preferred because of
        the higher stability provided by the ground frequency reference.
 
        The redundant transponders each consisted of an S-band and X-band
        receiver and transmitter.  The spacecraft was capable of receiving
        one uplink signal at S-band (2100 MHz) via the LGAs, at either
        X-band (7100 MHz) or S-band via HGA1, or at X-band only via HGA2.
        The spacecraft could transmit a downlink signal at S-band (2300 MHz)
        and (simultaneously) a downlink signal at X-band (8400 MHz) using
        HGA1; or it could transmit one downlink signal at S-band via the
        LGAs or one X-band signal using HGA2.
 
 
      Operational Considerations
      --------------------------
        Radio science observations often required operation of the spacecraft
        in orientations and configurations that were not compatible with
        spacecraft constraints, telecommunications, and requirements for
        other instruments.  There were also limitations within the Radio
        Science Team, which resulted in a prioritization of radio science
        observations.  The following list is representative but not complete.
 
          Thermal constraints were severe.  Spacecraft cooling panels could
          not be exposed to direct sunlight nor could other panels hosting
          payload components be exposed for more than a few minutes.  The
          -X spacecraft axis could never be closer than 90 degrees to the
          Sun direction, The minimum incidence angle on the +Z panel was 10
          degrees to protect optical instruments.  The +Y and -Y panels
          could be exposed to the Sun at incidence angles 80-90 degrees,
          but for no longer than one hour.
 
          Bistatic radar experiments could be conducted with HGA1 only if
          that antenna&apos;s boresight was within 90 degrees of the Sun direction.
          When Venus was between inferior conjunction and quadrature, all
          radio tracking and occultations were conducted using HGA2 (at
          X-Band only).
 
          Gravity observations were most interesting when two-way
          dual-frequency data could be collected as the spacecraft passed
          through pericenter.  But pericenter time was highly contested
          with several other instruments, which also sought those
          opportunities to acquire data with the highest resolution.
 
          Bistatic radar probing of anomalously reflecting, high altitude
          regions was most revealing when conducted near the Brewster angle.
          For dielectric constants of 3 (typical of sand), the Brewster
          angle is 60 degrees, measured from the local vertical.  For a
          dielectric constant of 10, the Brewster angle is 72 degrees.
          MAGELLAN bistatic radar had suggested dielectric constants with
          magnitudes as large as 100 in Maxwell Montes.  X-Band signal
          absorption in the neutral atmosphere made detection of surface
          echoes at incidence angles larger than 70 degrees nearly
          impossible; so experiments seeking information about the high
          altitude anomalies were preferentially scheduled for S-Band at
          incidence angle larger than 60 degrees.
 
          In the latter half of 2006, perhaps as early as 4 August and
          definitely by November, the performance of the on-board S-Band
          radio system deteriorated.  Tests showed that both the transmitted
          power from the spacecraft and signals reaching the on-board
          receiver were reduced by approximately 15 dB.  A switch between
          the transponders and HGA1 was suspected, but neither a specific
          fault nor a correction was identified.  Bistatic radar experiments,
          which depended on S-Band for surface echo detection, were
          suspended.  In other investigations, S-Band was de-emphasized
          since the noise accompanying the weak S-Band signal sometimes
          degraded the results compared with analysis of X-Band data alone.
 
 
 
      Calibration
      -----------
        For many experiments, calibration data were collected in conjunction
        with the scientific observations.  For example, carrier power and
        frequency could be determined before and/or after bistatic radar and
        radio occultation experiments when the antenna was pointed toward
        Earth.
 
        The beamwidth and pointing accuracy of HGA1 were calibrated during
        post-launch tests [ACCOMAZZO2006].  The half-power points were about
        3.3 and 0.86 degrees from the boresight at S- and X-band, respectively
        (compared with 3.5 and 0.96 degrees predicted).  The boresight itself
        was -0.32 deg toward the spacecraft +Y axis and 0.02 degrees toward
        the +Z axis at S-Band, compared with prediction; and it was -0.14
        degrees toward +Y and +0.04 degrees toward +Z at X-Band compared
        with prediction.
 
        For radio tracking data, error sources in two-way mode were estimated
        at 1.7 AU Earth-Venus distance using the New Norcia ground station,
        a 1 Hz tracking loop bandwidth, and 10 seconds integration were
        estimated to yield a thermal contribution to the Doppler velocity of
        0.004 mm/s [HAEUSLERETAL2005].
 
 
      Platform Mounting
      -----------------
        The high gain antenna HGA1 was rigidly attached to the +X wall of the
        spacecraft bus.  Therefore, the VEX HGA frame (VEX_HGA) was defined
        as a fixed offset frame with its orientation given relative to the
        VEX_SPACECRAFT frame:
 
          +Z axis of the HGA frame was in the antenna boresight direction
             (nominally -5 degrees off the spacecraft +X axis toward the
             spacecraft +Z axis);
          +Y axis of the HGA frame was in the direction of the spacecraft
             +Y axis;
          +X completed the right hand frame;
 
          The origin of the HGA frame was located at the geometric center of
          the HGA dish outer rim circle.

        Nominally a single rotation of -85 degrees about the +Y axis was
        needed to align the spacecraft frame with the HGA frame.
 
        The auxilliary high-gain antenna HGA2 was rigidly mounted to the
        +Z side of the spacecraft bus.  Its pointing direction was symmetric
        to HGA1 with respect to the +Z axis of the spacecraft frame.  The
        HGA2 frame was defined relative to the VEX_SPACECRAFT frame:
 
          +Z axis of the HGA2 frame was in the antenna boresight direction,
             +5 degrees off the spacecraft -X axis toward the spacecraft
             +Z axis.
          +Y axis was in the direction of the spacecraft +Y axis
          +X axis completes the right hand frame.
 
          The origin of the frame was located at the geometric center of
          the HGA2 dish outer rim circle.
 
 
      Operating Modes
      ---------------
        A two-way dual-frequency radio link was used for atmospheric drag
        campaigns, gravity observations, and solar corona investigations.
        Such a radio link benefited from the superior frequency stability
        of the ground station.
 
        A one-way dual-frequency radio link was used for radio occultation
        experiments because the uplink was a poor frequency reference during
        deep occultations.
 
        In the experiments above the dual-frequency downlink at X-band and
        S-band was used to separate classical and dispersive Doppler shifts,
        allowing correction of the observed frequency shift by any plasma
        contribution.  Note, however, that the S-Band link was compromised
        starting in late 2006; it was ineffective for estimating plasma
        effects and was discontinued for some observations (see Operational
        Considerations, above).
 
        A one-way dual-frequency radio link at S- and X-band was used for
        bistatic radar experiments.  In these experiments, HGA1 was pointed
        toward Venus and could not be used to capture an uplink signal,
        receive commands, or transmit telemetry.  After the S-Band link was
        compromised in August 2006, bistatic radar experiments were
        suspended (see Operational Considerations, above).
 
        In the above experiments, operation was preferred with full power
        in the carrier (no telemetry or other modulation on the downlink)
        to maximize signal-to-noise ratio.
 
 
    Instrument Specification - DSN
    ==============================
      Three Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) (near Barstow, CA;
      Canberra, Australia; and Madrid, Spain) comprised the DSN tracking
      network.  Each complex was equipped with several antennas [including
      at least one each 70-m, 34-m High Efficiency (HEF), and 34-m Beam
      WaveGuide (BWG)], associated electronics, and operational systems.
      Primary activity at each complex was radiation of commands to and
      reception of telemetry from active spacecraft.
 
      Transmission and reception was possible in several radio-frequency
      bands, the most common being S-band (nominally a frequency of
      2100-2300 MHz or a wavelength of 14.2-13.0 cm) and X-band (7100-8500
      MHz or 4.2-3.5 cm).  Transmitter output powers of up to 400 kW were
      available.
 
      The Deep Space Network was managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of
      the California Institute of Technology for the U.S. National Aeronautics
      and Space Administration.  Specifications included:

    Subsystems - DSN
    ----------------
      The Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) were an integral
      part of Radio Science instrumentation.  Their system performance
      directly determined the degree of success of Radio Science
      investigations, and their system calibration determined the degree
      of accuracy in the results of the experiments.  The following
      paragraphs describe the functions performed by the individual
      subsystems of a DSCC.  This material has been adapted from
      [ASMAR&amp;HERRERA1993] and [DSN871-049-041]; for additional information,
      consult [DSN810-5], [DSN821-110], and [DSN821-104].
 
      Each DSCC included a set of antennas, a Signal Processing
      Center (SPC), and communication links to the Jet Propulsion
      Laboratory (JPL).  The general configuration is illustrated
      below; not all antennas are shown.

      DSCC Monitor and Control Subsystem
      ----------------------------------
        The DSCC Monitor and Control Subsystem (DMC) was part of the
        Monitor and Control System (MON) which also included the
        ground communications Central Communications Terminal (CCT) and
        the Network Operations Control Center (NOCC) Monitor and Control
        Subsystem.  The DMC was the center of activity at a DSCC.  The
        DMC received and archived most of the information from the
        NOCC needed by the various DSCC subsystems during their
        operation.  Control of most of the DSCC subsystems, as well
        as the handling and displaying of any responses to control
        directives and configuration and status information received
        from each of the subsystems, was done through the DMC.  The
        effect of this was to centralize the control, display, and
        short-term archiving functions necessary to operate a DSCC.
        Communication among the various subsystems was done using a
        Local Area Network (LAN) hooked up to each subsystem via a
        network interface unit (NIU).
 
        DMC operations were divided into two separate areas: the
        Complex Monitor and Control (CMC) and the Network Monitor and
        Control (NMC).  The primary purpose of the CMC processor for
        Radio Science support was to receive and store all predict
        sets transmitted from NOCC -- such as antenna pointing,
        tracking, receiver, and uplink predict sets -- and then, at a
        later time, to distribute them to the appropriate subsystems
        via the LAN.  Those predict sets could be stored in the CMC for
        a maximum of three days under normal conditions.  The CMC also
        received, processed, and displayed event/alarm messages, and
        maintained an operator log.  Assignment and configuration of
        the NMCs was done through the CMC; to a limited degree the CMC
        could perform some of the functions performed by the NMC.  There
        were two CMCs (one on-line and one backup) and three NMCs at
        each DSCC.   The backup CMC could function as an additional NMC
        if necessary.
 
        The NMC processor provided the operator interface for monitor
        and control of a link -- a group of equipment required to
        support a spacecraft pass.  For Radio Science, a link might
        include one or more Radio Science Receivers (RSRs), the DSCC
        Uplink Subsystem (UPL), and one or more DSCC Downlink Tracking
        and Telemetry Subsystems (DTTs).  The NMC also maintained an
        operator log which included all operator directives and
        subsystem responses.  One important Radio Science-specific
        function that the NMC performed was receipt and transmission of
        the system temperature and signal level data from the PPM, for
        display at the NMC console, and for inclusion in Monitor
        blocks.  These blocks were recorded on magnetic tape as well
        as appearing in the NOCC displays.  The NMC was required to
        operate without interruption for the duration of the Radio
        Science data acquisition period.
 
        The Area Routing Assembly (ARA), which was part of the Digital
        Communications Subsystem, controlled all data communication
        between the stations and JPL.  The ARA received all required
        data and status messages from the NMC/CMC, and could record them
        to tape as well as transmit them to JPL via data lines.  The
        ARA also received predicts and other data from JPL, and passed
        them on to the CMC.
 
 
      DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem
      ---------------------------------
        Radio Science activities generally required support from
        the 70-m, 34-m HEF, and 34-m BWG antenna subnets.  The
        antennas at each DSCC functioned as large-aperture collectors
        which, by double reflection, caused the incoming radio
        frequency (RF) energy to enter the feed horns.  The large
        collecting surface of the antenna focused the incoming energy
        onto a subreflector, which was adjustable in both axial and
        angular position.  These adjustments were made to correct for
        gravitational deformation of the antenna as it moved between
        zenith and the horizon; the deformation could be as large as
        7 cm.  The subreflector adjustments optimizde the channeling
        of energy from the primary reflector to the subreflector,
        and then to the feed horns.  The 70-m and 34-m HEF antennas
        had &apos;shaped&apos; primary and secondary reflectors, with forms
        that were modified paraboloids.  This customization allowed
        more uniform illumination of one reflector by another.  The
        BWG reflector shape was ellipsoidal.
 
        On the 70-m antennas, the subreflector directed
        received energy from the antenna onto a dichroic plate, a
        device which reflected S-band energy to the S-band feed horn
        and passed X-band energy through to the X-band feed horn.  In
        the 34-m HEF, there was one &apos;common aperture feed,&apos; which
        accepted both frequencies without requiring a dichroic plate.
        In the 34-m BWG, a series of small mirrors (approximately 2.5
        meters in diameter) directed microwave energy from the
        subreflector region to a collection area at the base of
        the antenna -- typically in a pedestal room.  A retractable
        dichroic reflector separated the S and X bands on some BWG
        antennas, or the X and Ka bands on others.  RF energy to be
        transmitted into space by the horns was focused by the
        reflectors into narrow cylindrical beams, pointed with high
        precision (either to the dichroic plate or directly to the
        subreflector) by a series of drive motors and gear trains
        that could rotate the movable components and their support
        structures.
 
        The different antennas could be pointed by several means.  Two
        pointing modes commonly used during tracking passes were
        CONSCAN and &apos;blind pointing.&apos; With CONSCAN enabled and a
        closed-loop receiver locked to a spacecraft signal, the
        system tracked the radio source by conically scanning around
        its position in the sky.  Pointing angle adjustments were
        computed from signal strength information (feedback) supplied
        by the receiver.  In this mode the Antenna Pointing Assembly
        (APA) generated a circular scan pattern which was sent to the
        Antenna Control System (ACS).  The ACS added the scan pattern
        to the corrected pointing angle predicts.  Software in the
        receiver-exciter controller computed the received signal
        level and sent it to the APA.  The correlation of scan
        position with the received signal level variations allowed the
        APA to compute offset changes which were sent to the ACS.
        Thus, within the capability of the closed-loop control
        system, the scan center was pointed precisely at the apparent
        direction of the spacecraft signal source.  An additional
        function of the APA was to provide antenna position angles and
        residuals, antenna control mode/status information, and
        predict-correction parameters to the Area Routing Assembly
        (ARA) via the LAN, which then sent this information to JPL
        via the Ground Communications Facility (GCF) for antenna
        status monitoring.
 
        During periods when excessive signal level dynamics or low
        received signal levels were expected (e.g., during an
        occultation experiment), CONSCAN could not be used.  Under
        these conditions, blind pointing (CONSCAN OFF) was used, and
        pointing angle adjustments were based on a predetermined
        Systematic Error Correction (SEC) model.
 
        Independent of CONSCAN state, subreflector motion in at least
        the z-axis could introduce phase variations into the received
        Radio Science data.  For that reason, during certain
        experiments, the subreflector in the 70-m and 34-m HEFs was
        frozen in the z-axis at a position (often based on
        elevation angle) selected to minimize phase change and signal
        degradation.  This could be done via Operator Control Inputs
        (OCIs) from the NMC to the Subreflector Controller (SRC)
        which resided in the alidade room of the antennas.  The SRC
        passed the commands to motors that drove the subreflector to
        the desired position.
 
        Pointing angles for all antenna types were computed by
        the NOCC Support System (NSS) from an ephemeris provided by
        the flight project.  These predicts were received and archived
        by the CMC.  Before each track, they were transferred to the
        APA, which transformed the direction cosines of the predicts
        into AZ-EL coordinates.  The LMC operator then downloaded the
        antenna predict points to the antenna-mounted ACS computer
        along with a selected SEC model.  The pointing predicts
        consisted of time-tagged AZ-EL points at selected time intervals
        along with polynomial coefficients for interpolation between
        points.
 
        The ACS automatically interpolated the predict points,
        corrected the pointing predicts for refraction and
        subreflector position, and added the proper systematic error
        correction and any manually entered antenna offsets.  The ACS
        then sent angular position commands for each axis at the
        rate of one per second.  In the 70-m and 34-m HEF, rate
        commands were generated from the position commands at the
        servo controller and were subsequently used to steer the
        antenna.
 
        When not using binary predicts (the routine mode for
        spacecraft tracking), the antennas could be pointed using
        &apos;planetary&apos; mode -- a simpler mode which used right ascension
        (RA) and declination (DEC) values.  These changed very slowly
        with respect to the celestial frame.  Values were provided to
        the station in text form for manual entry.  The ACS
        quadratically interpolated among three RA and DEC points
        which were on one-day centers.
 
        A third pointing mode -- sidereal -- was available for
        tracking radio sources fixed with respect to the celestial
        frame.
 
        Regardless of the pointing mode being used, a 70-m antenna
        had a special high-accuracy pointing capability called
        &apos;precision&apos; mode.  A pointing control loop derived the
        main AZ-EL pointing servo drive error signals from a two-
        axis autocollimator mounted on the Intermediate Reference
        Structure.  The autocollimator projected a light beam to a
        precision mirror mounted on the Master Equatorial drive
        system, a much smaller structure, independent of the main
        antenna, which was exactly positioned in HA and DEC with shaft
        encoders.  The autocollimator detected elevation/cross-
        elevation errors between the two reference surfaces by
        measuring the angular displacement of the reflected light
        beam.  This error was compensated for in the antenna servo by
        moving the antenna in the appropriate AZ-EL direction.
        Pointing accuracies of 0.004 degrees (15 arc seconds) were
        possible in &apos;precision&apos; mode.  The &apos;precision&apos; mode was not
        available on 34-m antennas -- nor was it needed, since their
        beamwidths were twice as large as on the 70-m antennas.
 
 
      DSCC Antenna Microwave Subsystem
      --------------------------------
        70-m Antennas: Each 70-m antenna had three feed cones installed
        in a structure at the center of the main reflector.  The feeds
        were positioned 120 degrees apart on a circle.  Selection of the
        feed was made by rotation of the subreflector.  A dichroic mirror
        assembly, half on the S-band cone and half on the X-band cone,
        permitted simultaneous use of the S- and X-band frequencies.  The
        third cone was devoted to R&amp;D and more specialized work.
 
        The Antenna Microwave Subsystem (AMS) accepted the received S-
        and X-band signals at the feed horn and transmitted them through
        polarizer plates to an orthomode transducer.  The polarizer
        plates were adjusted so that the signals were directed to a pair
        of redundant amplifiers for each frequency, thus facilitating
        the simultaneous reception of signals in two orthogonal
        polarizations.  For S-band these were two Block IVA S-band
        Traveling Wave Masers (TWMs); for X-band the amplifiers were
        Block IIA TWMs.
 
        34-m HEF Antennas:  The 34-m HEF used a single feed for both
        S- and X-band.  Simultaneous S- and X-band receive as well as
        X-band transmit was possible thanks to the presence of an S/X
        &apos;combiner&apos; which acted as a diplexer.  For S-band, RCP or LCP
        was user selected through a switch, so neither a polarizer nor
        an orthomode transducer was needed.  The X-band amplification
        options included two Block II TWMs or a High Electron Mobility
        Transistor (HEMT) Low Noise Amplifier (LNA), while the S-band
        amplification was provided by a Field Effect Transistor (FET)
        LNA.
 
        34-m BWG Antennas: These antennas used feeds and low-noise
        amplifiers (LNA) in the pedestal room, which could be switched
        in and out as needed.  Typically the following modes were
        available:
 
           1. downlink non-diplexed path (RCP or LCP) to LNA-1, with
              uplink in the opposite circular polarization;
           2. downlink non-diplexed path (RCP or LCP) to LNA-2, with
              uplink in the opposite circular polarization;
           3. downlink diplexed path (RCP or LCP) to LNA-1, with
              uplink in the same circular polarization;
           4. downlink diplexed path (RCP or LCP) to LNA-2, with
              uplink in the same circular polarization.
 
        For BWG antennas with dual-band capabilities and dual LNAs,
        each of the above four modes could be used in a single- or
        dual-frequency configuration.  Thus, for antennas with the
        most complete capabilities, there were sixteen possible ways
        to receive (2 polarizations, 2 waveguide path choices, 2
        LNAs, and 2 bands).
 
 
      DSCC Uplink Subsystem
      ---------------------
        The Uplink Subsystem (UPL) comprised the Exciter, the Command
        Modulation, Uplink Controller, and Uplink Ranging assemblies.
        The UPL was based around the Block V Exciter (BVE) equipment.
        The BVEs generated uplink carrier and uplink range phase data,
        and delivered these data directly to the Project.
 
        The exciter generated a sky-level signal which was provided to
        the Transmitter Subsystem for the spacecraft uplink signal.
        Based on predicts from the CMC, the BVE provided a sky-level
        uplink signal to either the low-power or the high-power
        transmitter.  It was tunable under command of the DCO
        (Digitally Controlled Oscillator).
 
        The diplexer in the signal path between the transmitter and
        the feed horn for all antenna types (used for simultaneous
        transmission and reception) could be configured such that it was
        out of the received signal path (in listen-only or bypass
        mode) in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the
        receiver system.
 
 
      DSCC Downlink Subsystem
      -----------------------
        The Downlink Subsystem consisted of three groups of equipment:
        the closed-loop receiver group, the open-loop receiver group,
        and the RF monitor group.
 
        Closed-Loop Receivers: The current closed-loop group, called
        the Downlink Tracking and Telemetry Subsystem (DTK), consisted
        of the Downlink Controller, the Receiver and Ranging Processor
        (RRP), and the Telemetry Processor (TLP) assemblies.  The DTT
        was currently based around the Block V Receiver (BVR) equipment.
        The BVRs generated downlink carrier and downlink range phase
        data (not Doppler counts and ranging units, as had been the
        case before early 2003), and delivered these (phase) data
        directly to the Project.
 
        The DTT could simultaneously support as many downlink channels
        as could be assigned by the NMC, up to the total number of RRPs
        available at a given complex (allowing for the reception of
        several different frequencies/wavelengths/bands, or different
        polarizations of the same downlink band).  The only other
        constraint was that any selected downlink band/bands had to be
        supported by that antenna.
 
        The closed-loop receivers provided the capability for rapid
        acquisition of a spacecraft signal, and telemetry lock-up.  In
        order to accomplish signal acquisition within a short time, the
        receivers were predict driven to search for, acquire, and track
        the downlink automatically.  Rapid acquisition precluded manual
        tuning, though that remained as a backup capability.  The BVRs
        utilized FFT analyzers for rapid lock-up.  The downlink predicts
        were generated by the NSS and then transmitted to the CMC, which
        sent them to the Receiver Subsystem where two sets could be
        stored.  The receiver started acquisition at the beginning of
        a track (pass), or at an operator-specified time.  The BVRs could
        also be operated from the NMC without local operators attending
        them.  The receivers also sent performance and status data,
        displays, and event messages to the NMC.
 
        With the BVRs, the simulation (SIM) synthesizer signal was used
        as the reference for the Doppler extractor.  The synthesizer was
        adjusted before the beginning of the pass to a frequency that
        was appropriate for the channel (i.e., within the band) of the
        incoming signal; and would generally remain constant during the
        pass.
 
        The closed-loop receiver AGC loop could be configured to one
        of three settings: narrow, medium, or wide.  It was configured
        such that the expected amplitude changes were accommodated with
        minimum distortion.  The loop bandwidth (2BLo) was configured
        such that the expected phase changes could be accommodated while
        maintaining the best possible loop SNR.
 
        Open-Loop Receivers: The open-loop Radio Science Receiver (RSR)
        was a dedicated receiver that got a downconverted signal (about
        300 MHz), filtered the signal to limit its bandwidth (to 265-375
        MHz, centered at 320 MHz), and then further downconverted (to a
        center frequency of 64 MHz) and digitized the signal.  The RSR
        filters were specified by their bandwidths, desired resolution,
        and offset from the predicted sky frequency.
 
        The open-loop receivers operated in both a link-assigned and a
        stand-alone mode.  In the link-assigned mode, the NMC received
        monitor data from the RSR for incorporation into the data set
        for tracking support, and provided a workstation from which the
        RSR could be operated.  RSRs that were not assigned to a link could
        be operated in a stand-alone mode without interference to any
        activities in progress at the complex.  Monitor data were not sent
        to the NMC by RSRs operating in the stand-alone mode.
 
 
      DSCC Transmitter Subsystem
      --------------------------
        The Transmitter (TXR) Subsystem accepted a sky-level frequency
        exciter signal from the Uplink (Exciter) Subsystem exciter.
        This signal was routed via the diplexer through the feed horn
        to the antenna, where it was then focused and beamed to the
        spacecraft.
 
        The Transmitter Subsystem power capabilities ranged from 18 kW
        to 400 kW, for S- and X-band uplink.  Power levels above 20 kW
        were available only at 70-m stations.
 
 
      DSCC Tracking Subsystem
      -----------------------
        Beginning in early 2003, all the Tracking Subsystem functions
        were incorporated within the Uplink Subsystem (UPL) and the
        Downlink Tracking and Telemetry Subsystem (DTT) -- the DTK was
        eliminated.
 
 
      DSCC Frequency and Timing Subsystem
      -----------------------------------
        The Frequency and Timing Subsystem (FTS) provided all of the
        frequency and timing references required by the other DSCC
        subsystems.  It contained four frequency standards, of which
        one was prime and the other three were backups.  Selection of
        the prime standard was done via the CMC.  Of these four
        standards, two were hydrogen masers followed by clean-up loops
        (CUL) and two were cesium standards.  These four standards all
        fed the Coherent Reference Generator (CRG), which provided
        the frequency references used by the rest of the complex.  FTS
        also provided the frequency reference to the Master Clock
        Assembly (MCA), which in turn provided time to the Time
        Insertion and Distribution Assembly (TID), which provided UTC
        and SIM-time to the complex.
 
        JPL&apos;s ability to monitor the FTS at each DSCC was limited to
        the station-calculated Doppler pseudo-residuals, the Doppler
        noise, the RSR, the SSI, and to a system that used the Global
        Positioning System (GPS).  GPS receivers at each DSCC received
        a one-pulse-per-second signal from the station&apos;s (hydrogen-
        maser-referenced) FTS and a pulse from a GPS satellite at
        scheduled times.  After compensating for the satellite signal
        delay, the timing offset was reported to JPL, where a database
        was kept.  The clock offsets stored in the JPL database were
        given in microseconds; each entry was a mean reading of the
        measurements from several GPS satellites, and a time tag
        associated with the mean reading.  The clock offsets that were
        provided included those of SPC 10 relative to UTC (NIST), SPC
        40 relative to SPC 10, etc.
 
 
    Optics - DSN
    ============
      Performance of the DSN ground stations depended primarily on size
      of the antenna and capabilities of the electronics.  These are
      summarized in the following set of tables.  Beamwidth is
      half-power full angular width.  Polarization is circular; L
      denotes left circular polarization (LCP), and R denotes right
      circular polarization (RCP).

               at 8495 MHz, the frequency used by the Goldstone
               planetary radar system.  For telecommunications, the
               transmitting frequency was in the range 7145-7190
               MHz, the power would typically be 20 kW, and the gain
               would be about 72.6 dB (70-m antenna).  When ground
               transmitters were used in spacecraft radio science
               experiments, the details of transmitter and antenna
               performance rarely impacted the results.
 
 
    Calibration - DSN
    =================
      Calibrations of hardware systems were carried out periodically
      by DSN personnel; these ensured that systems operated at required
      performance levels -- for example, that antenna patterns,
      receiver gain, propagation delays, and Doppler uncertainties
      met specifications.  No information on specific calibration
      activities was available.  Nominal performance specifications
      are shown in the tables above.  Additional information may be
      available in [DSN810-5].
 
      Prior to each tracking pass, station operators performed a series
      of calibrations to ensure that systems met specifications for
      that operational period.  Included in these calibrations was
      measurement of receiver system temperature in the configuration
      to be employed during the pass.  Results of these calibrations
      were recorded in (hard copy) Controller&apos;s Logs for each pass.
 
 
    Operational Considerations - DSN
    ================================
      The DSN was a complex and dynamic &apos;instrument.&apos; Its performance
      for Radio Science depended on a number of factors from equipment
      configuration to meteorological conditions.  No specific
      information on &apos;operational considerations&apos; can be given here.
 
 
    Operational Modes - DSN
    =======================
 
      DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem
      ---------------------------------
        Pointing of DSCC antennas could be carried out in several ways.
        For details see the subsection &apos;DSCC Antenna Mechanical
        Subsystem&apos; in the &apos;Subsystem&apos; section.  Binary pointing was
        the preferred mode for tracking spacecraft; pointing
        predicts were provided, and the antenna simply followed those.
        With CONSCAN, the antenna scanned conically about the optimum
        pointing direction, using closed-loop receiver signal
        strength estimates as feedback.  In planetary mode, the
        system interpolated from three (slowly changing) RA-DEC
        target coordinates; this was &apos;blind&apos; pointing since there was
        no feedback from a detected signal.  In sidereal mode, the
        antenna tracked a fixed point on the celestial sphere.  In
        &apos;precision&apos; mode, the antenna pointing was adjusted using an
        optical feedback system.  In addition, it was possible on
        most antennas to freeze the z-axis motion of the subreflector
        to minimize phase changes in the received signal.
 
 
      DSCC Downlink Tracking and Telemetry Subsystem
      ----------------------------------------------
        The diplexer in the signal path between the transmitter and
        the feed horns on all antennas could be configured so that it
        was out of the received signal path in order to improve the
        signal-to-noise ratio in the receiver system.  This was known
        as the &apos;listen-only&apos; or &apos;bypass&apos; mode.
 
 
      Closed-Loop vs. Open-Loop Reception
      -----------------------------------
        Radio Science data could be collected in two modes: closed-
        loop, in which a phase-locked loop receiver tracked the
        spacecraft signal, or open-loop, in which a receiver sampled
        and recorded a band within which the desired signal presumably
        resided.  Closed-loop data were collected using Closed-Loop
        Receivers, and open-loop data were collected using Open-Loop
        Receivers in conjunction with the Full Spectrum Processing
        Subsystem (FSP).  See the Subsystems section for further
        information.
 
 
      Closed-Loop Receiver AGC Loop
      -----------------------------
        The closed-loop receiver AGC loop could be configured to one of
        three settings: narrow, medium, or wide.  In general, it was
        configured so that expected signal amplitude changes were
        accommodated with minimum distortion.  The loop bandwidth was
        typically configured so that expected phase changes could be
        accommodated while maintaining the best possible loop SNR.
 
 
      Coherent vs. Non-Coherent Operation
      -----------------------------------
        The frequency of the signal transmitted from the spacecraft
        could generally be controlled in two ways -- by locking to a
        signal received from a ground station or by locking to an
        on-board oscillator.  These were known as the coherent (or
        &apos;two-way&apos;) and non-coherent (&apos;one-way&apos;) modes, respectively.
        Mode selection was made at the spacecraft, based on commands
        received from the ground.  When operating in the coherent
        mode, the transponder carrier frequency was derived from the
        received uplink carrier frequency with a &apos;turn-around ratio&apos;
        as expressed in the table below:
 
            Uplink    Downlink    Turn-Around
             Band       Band         Ratio

        In the non-coherent mode, the downlink carrier frequency was
        derived from the spacecraft&apos;s on-board, crystal-controlled
        oscillator.  Either closed-loop or open-loop receivers (or
        both) could be used with either spacecraft frequency reference
        mode.  Closed-loop reception in the two-way mode was usually
        preferred for routine tracking/navigation.  Occasionally the
        spacecraft operated coherently such that one ground station
        did the transmitting, and a second/different ground station
        received the &apos;downlink&apos; signal -- this was referred to as the
        &apos;three-way&apos; mode.
 
 
      Media Calibration System
      ------------------------
        The Earth&apos;s atmosphere contributes phase and amplitude noise
        to the spacecraft radio signal received at a ground station.
        Each DSCC had a GPS receiver subsystem to calibrate for both
        the ionosphere and troposphere (both wet and dry components),
        along the zenith direction.  This subsystem also measured the
        temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed and direction, and
        Faraday rotation.
 
 
    Location - DSN
    ==============
      Accurate spacecraft navigation using radiometric data required
      knowledge of the locations of the DSN tracking stations.  The
      coordinate system in which the locations of the tracking stations
      were expressed needed to be consistent with the reference frame
      definitions used to provide Earth orientation calibrations.
 
      The International Earth Rotation Service (IERS) had established
      a terrestrial reference frame for use with Earth orientation
      measurements. The IERS issued a new realization of the terrestrial
      reference frame each year.  The definition of the coordinate
      system changed slowly as the data improved, and as ideas about
      how best to define the coordinate system developed.  The overall
      changes from year to year were at the level of as few centimeters.
      The 1993 version of the IERS Terrestrial Reference Frame (IRTF1993)
      was most used for DSN station locations.
 
      The DSN station locations were determined by use of VLBI
      measurements, and by conventional and GPS surveying.  Tables of
      station locations were available in either Cartesian or geodetic
      coordinates.  The geodetic coordinates were referred to a geoid
      with an equatorial radius of 6378136.3 m, and a flattening factor
      f=298.257, as described in IERS Technical Note 13.

      at epoch 1993.0 (assuming subreflector-fixed configuration) were

    Measurement Parameters - DSN
    ============================
 
      Open-Loop System
      ----------------
        Output from the Open-Loop Receivers (OLRs), as sampled and
        recorded by the Radio Science Receiver (RSR), was a stream of
        1-, 2-, 4-, 8-, or 16-bit I (In-Phase) and Q (Quadrature-Phase)
        samples.  The spacecraft transmitted an RF signal to an antenna,
        where the signal was downconverted to IF.  The RSR selected an
        IF signal for a particular frequency band and passed it through
        a digitizer (where it was attenuated and then mixed with timing
        information).  The signal was then decimated, filtered (to I&amp;Q
        samples), and then multiplied by the signal from a numerically
        controlled oscillator.  Finally, the RSR reduced the bandwidth
        and sample rate of the samples, and truncated the results (thus
        creating an offset of -0.5 in the output data).  The samples of
        data were packed into SFDU blocks (nominally containing a single
        second&apos;s worth of data), and a header was attached to provide
        the following associated data for the record:
 
        -  time tag for the first sample in the data block
        -  data source identification (DSS, RSR, and sub-channel), and
           frequency band
        -  data sample resolution (bits per sample) and rate (samples
           per second)
        -  filter gain, ADC RMS amplitude, and attenuation
        -  frequency and phase polynomial coefficients
 
 
      Closed-Loop System
      ------------------
        Since mid 2003, closed-loop data were recorded and provided in
        Tracking and Navigation Files (TNFs).  The TNFs were comprised
        of SFDUs that had variable-length, variable-format records
        with mixed typing (i.e., can contain ASCII, integer, and
        floating-point items in a single record).  These files all
        contained entries that included measurements of Doppler, range,
        and signal strength, along with status and uplink frequency
        information.
