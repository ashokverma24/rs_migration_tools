      Instrument Overview
      ===================
      This is a two-channel optical mechanical scanning radiometer
      termoskan designed for the scanning of Mars.  The Termoskan
      radiometer operates in two spectral bands: 8.5-12 microns and 0.5-
      0.95 microns.  The line-by-line scanning is achieved by means of a
      mirror oscillating in a stepwise fashion, perpendicular to the
      spacecraft motion velocity;  the frame scanning is accounted for
      by the motion of the spacecraft itself.  The instantaneous field-
      of-view value in both channels is 0.9 arcmin, the scanning angle
      6.1 degrees, and the scanning rate 1 line per second.  It provides
      a resolution at nadir of 1.8x1.8 km and a swath length of 650 km
      from the circular observational orbit of 6,300 km.  The area
      traversed in the direction of motion is a function of the length
      of the session.

      INSTRUMENT_SERIAL_NUMBER = 3
 
      Scientific Objectives Summary
      =============================
      The scientific objectives of this experiment were the following:
 
        o investigation of the daily and seasonal dynamics of the
          temperature condition on the surface.
 
        o measurement of the thermal inertia of martian soil.
 
        o detection of the humidified regions of surface and subsurface
          ice formations.
 
        o searching of the sources of internal heat.
 
      Instrument Calibration Description
      ==================================
      To provide the radiometric measurements during the scanning
      process, the instrument is calibrated relative to inner reference
      radiators and space.  The fore optics are included in the
      calibration with the exception of the scanning mirror.
 
      Operational Considerations
      ==========================
      The scanning was conducted under conditions of uninterrupted
      astro-solar spatial attitude control of the spacecraft.  Moreover,
      the axis-ifsight position in the center of Termoskan line is
      aligned with the solar-ray direction.  During scanning, the
      distance from the spacecraft to the planet surface and the
      velocity of the subsatellite point were varied.  As a result,
      changes in dimensions of the area traversed in the line direction
      and in line and frame resolution occurred.
 
      Visible Channel Detector
      ========================
      DETECTOR_TYPE           = SILICON PHOTODIODE
      DETECTOR_ASPECT_RATIO   = 1.0
      MINIMUM_WAVELENGTH      = 0.5
      MAXIMUM_WAVELENGTH      = 1.0
      NOMINAL_OPERATING_TEMPERATURE = 293
 
      The contrast of the thermal images on the whole scanning route is
      higher than in the short-wave raange because of the lower
      dependence of the thermal contrasts on the Sun&apos;s position during
      scanning.  A no-shadow condition in the visible spectrum gives
      rise to diminished contrast in channel 0.6-0.85 micron and allows
      the surface reflectance to be determined in that spectral range
 
      Thermal Channel Detector
      ========================
      DETECTOR_TYPE           = HG CD TE
      DETECTOR_ASPECT_RATIO   = 1.0
      MINIMUM_WAVELENGTH      = 8.0
      MAXIMUM_WAVELENGTH      = 13.0
      NOMINAL_OPERATING_TEMPERATURE = 180

      rise to diminished contrast in channel 0.6-0.85 micron and allows
      the surface reflectance to be determined in that spectral range.
 
      Instrument Mounting
      ===================
      The instrument was fixed to the spacecraft, pointing in the anti-
      solar direction.  There was no scan platform.
