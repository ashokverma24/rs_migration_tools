                                The Orbit Data Group
                                is usually the third of several groups of records in an
                                Orbit Data File (ODF). It contains the majority of the
                                data included in the file. The Orbit Data Group Header
                                is the first record in the Orbit Data Group; it is
                                usually followed by many Orbit Data Group data records,
                                ordered by time. All records in the Orbit Data Group
                                have 36 bytes. Their format and content follow the
                                specification in TRK-2-18, Revision E of 29 February 2008.

                                           The fractional part is in Field 4 (Item 5).  See Item

                                           A Doppler observable (in Hertz) is computed according

                                           mid-point of the compression interval  ti  to  tj.
